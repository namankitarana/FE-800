BUSINESS\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles (“EVs”) and energy generation and storage systems,\\nand also install and maintain such energy systems and sell solar electricity. We are the world’s first vertically integrated sustainable\\nenergy company, offering end-to-end clean energy products, including generation, storage and consumption. We have established and\\ncontinue to grow a global network of stores, galleries, vehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians, body shops, Supercharger\\nstations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products, and we continue to develop self-driving\\ncapability in order to improve vehicle safety. Our sustainable energy products, engineering expertise, intense focus to accelerate the\\nworld’s transition to sustainable energy, and business model differentiate us from other companies. \\n\\nWe currently produce and sell three fully electric vehicles: the Model S sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) and the Model 3\\nsedan. All of our vehicles offer high performance and functionality as well as attractive styling.\\n\\nWe commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and have continued to improve Model S by introducing performance, all-wheel drive\\ndual motor, and Autopilot options, as well as free over-the-air software updates. We commenced deliveries of Model X in September\\n2015. Model X offers seating for up to seven people, all-wheel drive, and our Autopilot functionality. We commenced deliveries of Model\\n3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market, in July 2017, and we have significantly ramped its production. We are now\\nembarking on the delivery of Model 3 in international markets and are focusing on lowering manufacturing costs while continuing to\\nincrease its production rate.\\n\\nWe also intend to bring additional all-electric vehicles to market in the future, including Model Y, the Tesla Semi truck, a pickup truck and\\na new version of the Tesla Roadster. The production of fully electric vehicles that meet consumers’ range and performance expectations\\nrequires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our design and vehicle\\nengineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop\\nelectric vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that have historically limited broad adoption of\\nelectric vehicles. As a result, our customers enjoy several benefits, including:\\n\\n• Long Range and Recharging Flexibility. Our vehicles offer ranges that significantly exceed those of any other commercially available\\nelectric vehicle. In addition, our vehicles incorporate our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any\\navailable electrical outlet, and also offer fast charging capability from our proprietary Supercharger network.\\n• High-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality. Our vehicles deliver instantaneous and sustained acceleration, an\\nadvanced Autopilot system with active safety and convenience features, and over-the-air software updates.\\n• Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. Our vehicles offer an attractive cost of ownership compared to internal combustion engine or\\nhybrid electric vehicles. Using only an electric powertrain enables us to create more energy-efficient vehicles that are mechanically\\nsimpler than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. The cost to charge our vehicles is less compared to\\nfueling internal combustion vehicles. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower relative maintenance costs than other vehicles\\ndue to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves.\\n\\nWe sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally. The benefits we receive from\\ndistribution ownership enable us to improve the overall customer experience, the speed of product development and the capital efficiency\\nof our business. We are also continuing to build our network of Superchargers and Destination Chargers in North America, Europe and\\nAsia to provide alternative convenient options for fast charging.\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn addition, we are leveraging our technological expertise in batteries, power electronics, and integrated systems to manufacture and sell\\nenergy storage products. In late 2016, we began production and deliveries of our latest generation energy storage products, Powerwall 2\\nand Powerpack 2. Powerwall 2 is a 14 kilowatt hour (“kWh”) home battery with an integrated inverter. Powerpack 2 is an infinitely scalable\\nenergy storage system for commercial, industrial and utility applications, comprised of up to 210 kWh (AC) battery packs and up to 650\\nkVa (at 480V) inverters. Similar to our electric vehicles, our energy storage products have been developed to receive over-the-air\\nfirmware and software updates that enable additional features over time.\\n\\nFinally, we sell and lease solar energy systems (with or without accompanying energy storage systems) to residential and commercial\\ncustomers and sell renewable energy to residential and commercial customers at prices that are typically below utility rates. Since 2006,\\nwe have installed solar energy systems for hundreds of thousands of customers. However, the electricity produced by our solar\\ninstallations represents a very small fraction of total U.S. electricity generation. With tens of millions of single-family homes and\\nbusinesses in our primary service territories, and many more in other locations, we have a large opportunity to expand and grow this\\nbusiness. We believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining momentum, as exemplified in part by the state of California\\nrecently requiring that new homes be built with solar generation starting in 2020. We also intend to ramp production of our innovative\\nSolar Roof product.\\n\\nWe manufacture our vehicle products primarily at our facilities in Fremont, California, Lathrop, California, Tilburg, Netherlands and at our\\nGigafactory 1 near Reno, Nevada. We manufacture our energy storage products at Gigafactory 1 and Tesla solar products at our U.S.\\nfacilities including in Buffalo, New York (Gigafactory 2). In January 2019, we began construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai in China,\\nwhere we intend to commence production of certain trims of Model 3 for the local market by the end of 2019.\\n\\nOur Products and Services\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nModel S\\n\\nModel S is a fully electric, four-door, five-adult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and high performance and our all-wheel\\ndrive dual motor system, which we also offer in a performance version. Model S 100D is the longest range all-electric production sedan in\\nthe world, and the performance version with the Ludicrous speed upgrade is the quickest accelerating production vehicle available.\\n\\nModel S introduced a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, our advanced Autopilot hardware to enable both active safety and\\nconvenience features, and over-the-air software updates. We believe the combination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and\\nenergy efficiency of Model S positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments.\\n\\nModel X\\n\\nModel X is the longest range all-electric production sport utility vehicle in the world, and offers high performance features such as our fully\\nelectric, all-wheel drive dual motor system and our Autopilot system. Model X can seat up to seven adults and incorporates a unique\\nfalcon wing door system for easy access to the second and third seating rows. Model X is sold in all markets where Model S is available.\\n\\nModel 3\\n\\nModel 3 is our third generation electric vehicle, which we began delivering in July 2017. Model 3 and its drive units are currently produced\\nat high volumes at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California and at Gigafactory 1, respectively, and we intend to begin production of\\ncertain vehicle trims for China at our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019. We have offered a number of variants of Model 3,\\nincluding performance, dual motor, single motor, long-range and medium-range, and intend to offer in the future a variant of Model 3 at a\\nstarting price of $35,000. We are now embarking on the delivery of Model 3 in international markets and are focusing on lowering\\nmanufacturing costs while continuing to increase its production rate.\\n\\n2\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFuture Consumer and Commercial EVs\\n\\nIn addition to our volume-produced consumer EVs, including future vehicles such as Model Y and a pickup truck, we are planning to\\nintroduce additional types of vehicles to address a broader cross-section of the vehicle market, including commercial EVs such as the\\nTesla Semi truck, and a new version of the Tesla Roadster. We have started to accept reservations for the Tesla Semi truck and the new\\nTesla Roadster.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nUsing the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems, we developed\\nenergy storage products for use in homes, commercial facilities and on the utility grid. Advances in battery architecture, thermal\\nmanagement and power electronics that were originally commercialized in our vehicles are now being leveraged in our energy storage\\nproducts. Our energy storage systems are used for numerous applications including backup power, grid independence, peak demand\\nreduction, demand response, reducing intermittency of renewable generation, replacement of fossil fuel generation and wholesale electric\\nmarket services.\\n\\nOur energy product portfolio includes systems with a wide range of applications, from residential to large grid-scale projects. Powerwall 2\\nis a 14 kWh rechargeable lithium-ion battery designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility and can be used to provide\\nseamless backup power in a grid outage and to maximize self-consumption of solar power generation. In addition, we offer the\\nPowerpack 2 system, a fully integrated energy storage solution comprised of up to 210kWh (AC) battery packs and up to 650 kVa (at\\n480V) inverters that can be grouped together to form megawatt hour (“MWh”) and gigawatt hour (“GWh”) sized installations. The\\nPowerpack 2 system can be used by commercial and industrial customers for peak shaving, load shifting, self-consumption of solar\\ngeneration and demand response, as well as to provide backup power during grid outages, and by utilities and independent power\\nproducers to smooth and firm the output of renewable power generation sources, provide dynamic energy capacity to the grid, defer or\\neliminate the need to upgrade transmission or distribution infrastructure, and provide a variety of other grid services such as frequency\\nregulation and voltage control. Powerpack 2 can also be combined with renewable energy generation sources to create microgrids that\\nprovide communities with clean, resilient and affordable power.\\n\\nAlong with designing and manufacturing energy storage products, we continue to develop and advance our software capabilities for the\\ncontrol and optimal dispatch of energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nThe major components of our solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current, inverters that convert\\nthe electrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid, racking that attaches the solar panels to the roof\\nor ground, electrical hardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid, and our monitoring device. While we have\\nrecently started manufacturing solar panels at Gigafactory 2 in collaboration with Panasonic, we currently purchase the majority of system\\ncomponents from vendors, maintaining multiple sources for each major component to ensure competitive pricing and an adequate supply\\nof materials. We also design and manufacture other system components.\\n\\nThe residential solar energy systems that we sell enable our customers to take direct advantage of federal tax credits to reduce their\\nelectricity costs. Our solar loan offering enables customers to own their solar energy systems with little upfront cost. We also continue to\\noffer lease and power purchase agreement (“PPA”) options to both residential and commercial customers. Our current standard leases\\nand PPAs have a 20-year term, and we typically offer customers the opportunity to renew their agreements.\\n\\nIn October 2016, we unveiled Solar Roof, which integrates solar energy production with aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing\\ntiles and is designed to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings while turning sunlight into electricity. We have\\nbeen installing this product at a slow pace to gather learnings about our design and installation processes, and plan to ramp the\\nproduction of Solar Roof with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019.\\n\\n3\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nOur core competencies are powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage. Our core\\nintellectual property includes our electric powertrain, our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric\\npowertrain and our development of self-driving technologies. Our powertrain consists of our battery pack, power electronics, motor,\\ngearbox and control software. We offer several powertrain variants for our vehicles that incorporate years of research and development.\\nIn addition, we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies, such as mobile computing,\\nsensing, displays, and connectivity.\\n\\nBattery Pack\\n\\nWe design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety, reliability and long life. Our\\nproprietary technology includes systems for high density energy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and\\nelectronics management. We have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs\\nwith high quality at low cost.\\n\\nWe have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithium-ion cells in the automotive environment, and\\nhave further optimized cell designs to increase overall performance. These advancements have enabled us to improve over time the cost\\nand performance of our batteries.\\n\\nOur engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longer-term goal of building a foundation for further development.\\nFor instance, we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor. We maintain\\nextensive testing and R&D capabilities at the individual cell level, the full battery-pack level and on other critical battery pack systems, and\\nhave built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell vendors, chemistry types, and performance characteristics. We believe that\\nthe flexibility of our designs, combined with our research and real-world performance data, will enable us to continue to evaluate new\\nbattery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles.\\n\\nPower Electronics\\n\\nThe power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and\\nserve to power our electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging.\\n\\nThe drive inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive our induction and permanent magnet\\nmotors and provides “regenerative braking” functionality, which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack. The primary\\ntechnological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package with high\\nefficiency and low cost.\\n\\nThe charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct\\ncurrent that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this\\ncharger, from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses.\\n\\nDual Motor Powertrain\\n\\nWe offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive\\nconfiguration. Tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The\\nnear-instantaneous response of the motors, combined with low centers of gravity, provides drivers with controlled performance and\\nincreased traction control.\\n\\n4\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\n\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous\\nprocessors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. Software algorithms\\ncontrol traction, vehicle stability, the acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle, climate control and thermal management, and\\nare also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the\\ninformation and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times\\nand control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally.\\n\\nSelf-Driving Development\\n\\nWe have expertise in developing self-driving systems, and currently offer in our vehicles an advanced driver assist system that we refer to\\nas Autopilot, including auto-steering, traffic aware cruise control, automated lane changing, automated parking, Summon and driver\\nwarning systems. In October 2016, we began equipping all Tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full self-driving capability, including\\ncameras that provide 360 degree visibility, updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection, a forward-facing radar with enhanced\\nprocessing, and a powerful new onboard computer. Our Autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially\\ndangerous aspects of road travel. Although, at present, the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our system provides\\nsafety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions\\npermit. This hardware suite, along with over-the-air firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera, radar,\\nultrasonics, and GPS, enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance.\\n\\nAdditionally, we continue to make significant advancements in the development of fully self-driving technologies.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nWe are leveraging many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products, including high\\ndensity energy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and electronics management. By taking a modular\\napproach to the design of battery systems, we are able to maximize manufacturing capacity to produce both Powerwall and Powerpack\\nproducts. Additionally, we are making significant strides in the area of bi-directional, grid-tied power electronics that enable us to\\ninterconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and\\nabsorption.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nWe are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy systems business. For\\nexample, Solar Roof is being designed to work seamlessly with Tesla Powerwall 2 and we have developed proprietary software to reduce\\nsystem design and installation timelines and costs.\\n\\nDesign and Engineering\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nIn addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design\\nand engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and\\ncooling and low voltage electrical systems in-house, and to a lesser extent, in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core\\ncompetencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models.\\n\\n5\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAdditionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass\\non range. Model S and Model X are built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporate a variety of materials and\\nproduction methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle. Moreover, we have designed Model 3 with a mix of materials to be\\nlightweight and safe while also increasing cost-effectiveness for this mass-market vehicle. We are designing Model Y on the Model 3\\nplatform and expect that Model Y will share about 75% of its components with Model 3, which we expect will reduce the cost and time to\\nramp production of Model Y.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nWe have an in-house engineering team that both designs our energy storage products themselves, and works with our residential,\\ncommercial and utility customers to design bespoke systems incorporating our products. Our team’s expertise in electrical, mechanical,\\ncivil and software engineering enables us to create integrated energy storage solutions that meet the particular needs of all customer\\ntypes.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nWe also have an in-house engineering team that designs a customized solar energy system or Solar Roof for each of our customers, and\\nwhich works closely with our energy storage engineering teams to integrate an energy storage system when requested by the customer.\\nWe have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and optimizes the design to maximize the energy\\nproduction of each system. Our engineers complete a structural analysis of each building and produce a full set of structural design and\\nelectrical blueprints that contain the specifications for all system components. Additionally, we design complementary mounting and\\ngrounding hardware where required.\\n\\nSales and Marketing\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nCompany-Owned Stores and Galleries\\n\\nWe market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries, which we\\nbelieve enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand,\\nand obtain rapid customer feedback. Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets,\\nsome of which combine retail sales and service. We have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase\\ndemand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly\\nexpand our retail footprint. We refer to these as “Service Plus” locations.\\n\\nUsed Car Sales\\n\\nOur used car business supports new car sales by integrating the sale of a new Tesla vehicle with a customer’s trade-in needs for their\\nexisting Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire through trade-ins are subsequently remarketed,\\neither directly by us or through third-party auto auctions. We also receive used Tesla vehicles to resell through lease returns and other\\nsources.\\n\\nCharging\\n\\nWhen not charging at home or at work, Tesla customers can also charge using our Supercharger and Destination Charging networks. In\\naddition, our vehicles can charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or through a suite of adapters.\\nThis flexibility provides our customers with many charging options to suit various situations.\\n\\n6\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe continue to build out our Tesla Supercharger network throughout North America, Europe, Asia and other markets for our customers’\\nconvenience, including to enable long-distance travel and urban ownership. Our Supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative\\ndesigned to provide publicly accessible fast charging solutions, and remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused\\nby the perception of limited vehicle range. The Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to recharge a\\nTesla vehicle significantly more quickly than other charging options, and we continue to evolve our technology to allow for even faster\\ncharging times at lower cost to us. To satisfy growing demand, Supercharger stations typically have between six and thirty Superchargers\\nand are strategically placed along well-traveled routes and in dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick,\\nreliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network is either free or requires a competitive\\nfee.\\n\\nWe work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail, and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer\\nadditional charging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to\\nprovide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single-family\\nhomeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home charging solutions in our communities.\\n\\nWhere possible, we are co-locating Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce the cost of electricity and\\npromote the use of renewable electricity by Tesla vehicle owners.  \\n\\nOrders\\n\\nWe offer our customers the flexibility to order vehicles with their desired trims and options by visiting us online at our website or in person\\nat our Tesla stores.\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue\\nto do so. To date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our vehicle sales leads and have helped us\\nachieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.\\n\\nSolar and Energy Storage\\n\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to individuals, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a\\nvariety of channels.\\n\\nIn the U.S., we have been transitioning the direct sales channel for residential solar and energy storage products from former partners to\\nour stores and galleries. We are also continuing to sell residential energy storage products through our network of channel partners.\\nOutside of the U.S., we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell residential energy\\nstorage products, and we have recently launched pilot programs for the sale of residential solar in certain countries. We also sell\\nPowerwall 2 directly to utilities, who then deploy the product in customer homes.\\n\\nWe sell Powerpack 2 systems to commercial and utility customers through our international sales organization, which consists of\\nexperienced energy industry professionals in all of our target markets, as well as through our channel partner network. In the U.S and\\nMexico, we also sell installed solar energy systems (with or without energy storage) to commercial customers through cash, lease and\\nPPA transactions.\\n\\nService and Warranty\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nService\\n\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service centers, at our Service Plus locations or through an expanding\\nfleet of Tesla Mobile Service technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift. Performing vehicle service ourselves\\nallows us to identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers.\\n\\n7\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOur vehicles are designed with the capability to wirelessly upload data to us via an on-board system with cellular connectivity, allowing us\\nto diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle. When maintenance or service is required, a customer can\\nschedule service by contacting one of our Tesla service centers or our Mobile Service technicians can perform an array of services from a\\ncustomer’s home or other remote location.\\n\\nNew Vehicle Limited Warranty, Maintenance and Extended Service Plans\\n\\nWe provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every new vehicle, subject to separate limited warranties for the\\nsupplemental restraint system and battery and drive unit. For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model S and Model X vehicles,\\nwe offer an eight year, infinite mile limited warranty, although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered. For the battery and drive unit\\non our current new Model 3 vehicles, we offer an eight year or 100,000 mile limited warranty for our standard or mid-range battery and an\\neight year or 120,000 mile limited warranty for our long range battery, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty\\nperiod.\\n\\nIn addition to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, we currently offer for Model S and Model X a comprehensive maintenance program for\\nevery new vehicle, which includes plans covering prepaid maintenance for up to four years or up to 50,000 miles and an Extended\\nService plan. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of certain wear and tear parts, excluding tires and\\nthe battery. The Extended Service plan covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for up to an additional four years or up to an\\nadditional 50,000 miles after the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nWe generally provide a 10 year “no defect” and “energy retention” warranty with every Powerwall 2 and a 15 year “no defect” and “energy\\nretention” warranty with every Powerpack 2 system. For Powerwall 2, the energy retention warranty involves us guaranteeing that the\\nenergy capacity of the product will be 70% or 80% (depending on the region of installation) of its nameplate capacity after 10 years of\\nuse. For Powerpack 2, the energy retention warranty involves us guaranteeing a minimum energy capacity in each of its first 15 years of\\nuse. For both products, our warranty is subject to specified use restrictions or kWh throughput caps. In addition, we offer certain extended\\nwarranties, which customers are able to purchase from us at the time they purchase an energy storage system, including a 20 year\\nextended protection plan for Powerwall 2 and a selection of 10 or 20 year performance guarantees for Powerpack 2. We agree to repair\\nor replace our energy storage products in the event of a valid warranty claim.  In circumstances where we install a Powerwall 2 or\\nPowerpack 2 system, we also provide warranties of up to 20 years on our installation workmanship. All of the warranties for our energy\\nstorage systems are subject to customary limitations and exclusions.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nFor traditional solar energy systems, we provide a workmanship warranty for up to 20 years from installation and a separate warranty\\nagainst roof leaks. We also pass-through the inverter and module manufacturer warranties (typically 12 years and 25 years respectively).\\nWhen we lease a traditional solar energy system, we compensate the customer if their system produces less energy than guaranteed\\nover a specified period. For Solar Roof, we provide a warranty against glass tile chipping or cracking for the lifetime of the home, a 30\\nyear installation warranty, a 30 year weatherization warranty and a power output warranty. For all systems (traditional and Solar Roof) we\\nalso provide service and repair (either under warranty or for a fee) during the entire term of the customer relationship.\\n\\nFinancial Services\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We\\nalso currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada. We intend to broaden our\\nfinancial services offerings during the next few years. \\n\\n8\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCertain of our current financing programs outside of North America provide customers with a resale value guarantee under which those\\ncustomers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us at a preset future date, generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan\\nor financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. In certain markets, we also offer vehicle buyback guarantees to financial\\ninstitutions, which may obligate us to repurchase the vehicles for a pre-determined price.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nWe are an industry leader in offering innovative financing alternatives that allow our customers to take direct advantage of available tax\\ncredits and incentives to reduce the cost of owning a solar energy system through a solar loan, or to make the switch to solar energy with\\nlittle to no upfront costs under a lease or PPA. Our solar loan offers third-party financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the\\ncustomer to purchase and own a solar energy system. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the\\nthird-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. Our solar lease offers customers a fixed\\nmonthly fee, at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills, and an electricity production guarantee. Our solar PPA charges\\ncustomers a fee per kWh based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. We monetize the customer payments\\nwe receive from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors. We also intend to introduce financial services\\nofferings for our Solar Roof customers in the future.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nWe currently offer a loan product to residential customers who purchase Powerwall 2 together with a new solar energy system, and lease\\nand PPAs to commercial customers who purchase a Powerpack 2 system together with a new solar energy system. We intend to\\nintroduce financial services offerings for customers who purchase standalone energy storage products in the future.\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nWe conduct vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at our facilities in Fremont, California; Lathrop, California; and Tilburg,\\nNetherlands. We have also built and continue to expand Gigafactory 1, a manufacturing facility for battery cells, modules, packs and\\nstorage products and vehicle components, outside of Reno, Nevada. We are also constructing Gigafactory Shanghai, a manufacturing\\nfacility in China, for the production of Model 3 vehicles for the local market.\\n\\nManufacturing Facilities in Fremont, CA and Lathrop, CA\\n\\nWe manufacture our vehicles, and certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, at our\\nmanufacturing facilities in Fremont, CA, including the Tesla Factory, and our manufacturing facility in Lathrop, CA. Our Fremont facilities\\ncontain several manufacturing operations, including stamping, machining, casting, plastics, body assembly, paint operations, drive unit\\nproduction, seat assembly, final vehicle assembly and end-of-line testing. In addition, we manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric\\nmotors, gearboxes and components for Model S and Model X at the Tesla Factory. Some major vehicle component systems are\\npurchased from suppliers; however, we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the Tesla Factory.\\n\\nThe Netherlands\\n\\nOur European headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in Amsterdam and Tilburg. Our operations in Tilburg include final\\nassembly, testing and quality control for Model S and Model X vehicles delivered within the European Union, a parts distribution\\nwarehouse for service centers throughout Europe, a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center.\\n\\nGigafactory 1 outside of Reno, Nevada\\n\\nGigafactory 1 is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material, cell, module and battery pack production\\nin one location. We use the battery packs manufactured at Gigafactory 1 for our vehicles, including Model 3, and energy storage\\nproducts. We also manufacture Model 3 drive units at Gigafactory 1.\\n\\n9\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nGigafactory 1 is being built in phases. Tesla, Panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections. Our\\npresent plan is to continue expanding Gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately\\n500,000 vehicle per year capacity that we announced when we first started developing it, and we have additionally added capacity for\\nmanufacturing our energy storage products. We have also announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y, which we intend to\\nproduce at high volumes by the end of 2020, at Gigafactory 1.\\n\\nWe believe that Gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs with our volume production of\\nModel 3. We have an agreement with Panasonic to partner with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it is\\nusing to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Through our ownership of Gigafactory 1 and our partnership with Panasonic, we\\nown sole access to a facility designed to be the highest-volume and lowest-cost source of lithium-ion batteries in the world.\\n\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\n\\nWe are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing\\ntransportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S. We broke ground in January\\n2019, and subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing\\nproduction equipment and bringing the factory online, we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai\\nby the end of 2019. We expect much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing, supported by\\nlimited direct capital expenditures by us. Moreover, we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory\\nto be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory, from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify\\nour manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\nSupply Chain\\n\\nOur vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers. We have developed close\\nrelationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts. While we obtain\\ncomponents from multiple sources in some cases, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our\\nvehicles are purchased by us from a single source. In addition, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery\\npacks are available, we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles. We are\\nworking to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers.\\n\\nWe use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw\\nmaterials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or\\nsources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements.\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nOur energy storage products are manufactured at Gigafactory 1. We leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we\\nuse for our vehicles. The battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to\\nthose used in our vehicles’ battery pack, enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of\\nscale. The power electronics and inverters for the Powerwall and Powerpack systems are also manufactured at Gigafactory 1, allowing us\\nto ship deployment-ready systems directly to customers.\\n\\n10\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nWe currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers. We typically purchase\\nsolar panels and inverters on an as-needed basis from our suppliers at then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under\\nour master contractual arrangements. In December 2016, we entered into a long-term agreement with Panasonic to manufacture\\nphotovoltaic (“PV”) cells and modules with negotiated pricing provisions at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York with the intended\\ncapacity to manufacture at least 1.0 gigawatt (“GW”) of solar products annually. We have recently started manufacturing solar panels at\\nthis facility in collaboration with Panasonic.\\n\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nCalifornia Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives\\n\\nWe have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation\\nFinancing Authority (“CAEATFA”) that provide multi-year sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used\\nfor specific purposes, including the expansion and ongoing development of Model S, Model X, Model 3 and future electric vehicles and\\nthe expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in California.\\n\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\n\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory 1, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in\\nNevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real property, personal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff\\nenergy rates and transferable tax credits. These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and\\nending on either June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible for a maximum\\nof $195.0 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least $3.50 billion,\\nwhich we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1, which we exceeded during 2018. As a result, as of\\nDecember 31, 2018, we had earned the maximum amount of credits.\\n\\nTesla Regulatory Credits\\n\\nIn connection with the production, delivery, placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles, charging\\ninfrastructure and solar systems in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits. We have\\nsold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to\\ncomply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation\\nand those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as\\nZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other\\nregulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. Tesla also earns other\\ntypes of salable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels credits.\\nLikewise, several U.S. states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. These requirements enable\\ncompanies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”).\\n\\nRegulation—Vehicle Safety and Testing\\n\\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by the\\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards\\n(“FMVSS”). Our vehicles fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions, and we expect future Tesla\\nvehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies. Additionally, there are regulatory changes\\nbeing considered for several FMVSS, and while we anticipate compliance, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are\\nenacted.\\n\\n11\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAs a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or\\notherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the U.S. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as\\ncrash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to comply with\\nother federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information\\nlabeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and\\nforeign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.\\n\\nThe Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the\\nmanufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted.\\n\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations\\nare different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. The European Union has established new rules\\nregarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the\\nUnited Kingdom’s impending withdrawal from the European Union.  These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in\\nEurope.\\n\\nRegulation – Self Driving\\n\\nThere are no federal U.S. regulations pertaining to the safety of self-driving vehicles; however, NHTSA has established recommended\\nguidelines. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This\\npatchwork increases the legal complexity for our vehicles. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-driving braking and\\nsteering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of self-driving vehicles. Self-driving laws and\\nregulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and foreign countries, and may create restrictions on\\nself-driving features that we develop.\\n\\nRegulation—Battery Safety and Testing\\n\\nOur battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries,\\nwhich may present a risk in transportation. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck,\\nor air. We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with applicable\\nregulations.\\n\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs. The use, storage, and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal\\nlaw. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs. \\n\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\n\\nState laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers\\nto be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers, we\\nsecure dealer licenses (or their equivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers. A few states, such as\\nMichigan and Connecticut, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or\\notherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed\\nas a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the Internet, phone or mail. In such states, we have opened “galleries” that\\nserve an educational purpose and are not sales locations.\\n\\nAs we expand our retail footprint in the U.S., some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our\\noperations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or\\nexpand to new locations. We expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model. In addition, we\\nexpect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in\\nways not favorable to Tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations, and we intend to actively fight any such\\nefforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles.\\n\\n12\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nThe regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development. Nevertheless, there are various policies, incentives and\\nfinancial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage. For example, energy storage\\nsystems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30% tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or\\nthe IRC, as described below. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage,\\nand behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program.\\n\\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In 2011 and 2013, FERC removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation\\nservice, thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets. More recently, in late 2016, FERC released a\\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking that, if it becomes a final rule, would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully\\nparticipating in wholesale energy markets. Finally, in January 2017, FERC issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as\\nboth electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently, thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the\\nelectric grid.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nGovernment and Utility Programs and Incentives\\n\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of\\nsolar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and\\nrebates.\\n\\nThe federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit (“ITC”) under two sections of the IRC: Section 48 and\\nSection 25D. Section 48(a)(3) of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar\\nenergy system that commences construction by December 31, 2019. The credit then declines to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and a\\npermanent 10% thereafter. We claim the Section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects,\\nbased on ownership of the solar energy system. The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial\\nsolar energy systems. Section 25D of the IRC allows a homeowner-taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a\\nresidential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31, 2019. The credit then declines to\\n26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, and is scheduled to expire thereafter. Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or\\nthrough our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit.\\n\\nIn addition to the federal ITC, many U.S. states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy systems.\\n\\nRegulation – General\\n\\nWe are not a “regulated utility” in the U.S. To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities. In most cases,\\ninterconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the public utility commission or other\\nregulatory body. \\n\\nSales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, face regulatory challenges in some\\nstates and jurisdictions.\\n\\nRegulation – Net Metering\\n\\nMost states in the U.S. have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net\\nmetering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility\\nelectricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In\\ncertain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering, or have proposed to do so.\\n\\n13\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nRegulation – Mandated Renewable Capacity\\n\\nMany states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production, such as an enforceable renewable portfolio\\nstandard, or RPS, or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to\\ncustomers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems. In SREC state markets, the RPS requires\\nelectricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators. The SREC program provides a means for SRECs to be\\ncreated. A SREC represents the renewable energy associated with 1,000 kWhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system. When\\na solar energy system generates 1,000 kWhs of electricity, one SREC is issued by a government agency, which can then be sold\\nseparately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the state’s\\nrenewable energy mandate.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nVehicles\\n\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce\\nadditional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market.\\n\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their\\npropulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3\\ncompetes with small to medium-sized sedans, which are extremely competitive markets with internal combustion vehicles from more\\nestablished automobile manufacturers.\\n\\nMoreover, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel\\nvehicle market. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel\\nvehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles, particularly those fueled by electricity, relative to the internal\\ncombustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today, and other current and prospective\\nautomobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and\\nother foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the U.S. market as well. In addition, several\\nmanufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. \\n\\nEnergy Storage\\n\\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive. Established companies, such as AES Energy Storage, Siemens, LG\\nChem and Samsung, as well as various emerging companies, have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio. There\\nare several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems (such as cells, battery modules, and power\\nelectronics) as well as others providing integrated systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and\\nefficiency. We believe that the specifications of our products, our strong brand, and the modular, scalable nature of our Powerpack 2\\nproduct give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems\\n\\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential\\ncustomers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which\\ncustomers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide\\nproducts and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing\\nfor these installations.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially\\naffect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and\\nuncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\\n\\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch,\\nproduction, delivery and servicing ramp of new vehicles and other products such as Model 3, Model Y, our energy storage products and\\nSolar Roof, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe have previously experienced launch, manufacturing, production and delivery ramp delays or other complications in connection with\\nnew vehicle models such as Model S, Model X and Model 3, new vehicle features such as the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on\\nModel S and the second version of Autopilot hardware, and a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of Model 3.\\nFor example, we encountered unanticipated challenges, such as certain supply chain constraints, that led to initial delays in producing\\nModel X. Similarly, we experienced certain challenges in the production of Model 3 that led to delays in its ramp. Moreover, in the areas\\nof Model 3 production where we had challenges ramping fully automated processes, such as portions of the battery module assembly\\nline, material flow system and the general assembly line, we reduced the levels of automation and introduced semi-automated or manual\\nprocesses. If issues like these arise or recur, if our remediation measures and process changes do not continue to be successful, if we\\nexperience issues with transitioning to full automation in certain production lines or to other planned manufacturing improvements, or if we\\nexperience issues or delays in building our Gigafactory Shanghai in China or commencing and ramping Model 3 production there, we\\ncould experience issues in sustaining the Model 3 ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production further. Also, if we encounter\\ndifficulties in scaling our delivery or servicing capabilities for Model 3 or future vehicles and products to high volumes in the U.S. or\\ninternationally, our financial condition and operating results could suffer. In addition, because our vehicle models share certain production\\nfacilities with other vehicle models, the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other\\nmodels or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models.\\n\\nWe may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles, such\\nas Model Y, the Tesla Semi, our planned pickup truck and new Tesla Roadster, our energy storage products and Solar Roof. Any\\nsignificant additional delay or other complication in the production of and delivery capabilities for our current products or the development,\\nmanufacture, launch, production and delivery and servicing capability ramp of our future products, including complications associated with\\nexpanding our production capacity, supply chain and delivery systems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals, could materially\\ndamage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume\\ntargets for the production and ramp of Model 3, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture, market and sell the Model 3 vehicle,\\nwhich we are offering at a lower price point and which we are producing at significantly higher volumes than the Model S or Model X\\nvehicles. We commenced production and initial customer deliveries of Model 3 in July 2017, and since then have achieved a stabilized\\nproduction rate. At the Tesla Factory, we expect to continue to increase our Model 3 production rate to approximately 7,000 units per\\nweek on a sustained basis by the end of 2019. Moreover, in China, we expect to commence production of certain trims of Model 3 for the\\nlocal market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019, and then progressively increase levels of\\nlocalization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai, our goal is to be able to produce 10,000 Model\\n3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis, and an annualized output rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the\\nfourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. However, the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at Gigafactory\\nShanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing\\nproduction equipment and bringing the factory online.\\n\\n16\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we recently achieved and to which we anticipate\\nramping further for Model 3, and to be successful, we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and cost-effective\\nmanufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes, including at Gigafactory Shanghai. We are\\nemploying a higher degree of automation in the manufacturing processes for Model 3 than we have previously employed and to continue\\nto implement additional automation. In some cases, we have temporarily reduced the levels of automation and introduced\\nsemi-automated or manual processes, at additional labor cost. Additional bottlenecks may also arise as we continue to ramp production\\nat the Tesla Factory and commence the initial phase of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai, and it will be important that we\\naddress them promptly and in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, our Model 3 production plan has generally required to date significant\\ninvestments of cash and management resources, and we expect to deploy some level of additional resources as we further progress our\\nramp and begin production in new locations in the future, such as China.\\n\\nOur production plan for Model 3 is based on many key assumptions, including:\\n\\n• that we will be able to sustain and further expand our high-volume production of Model 3 at the Tesla Factory without exceeding our\\nprojected costs and on our projected timeline;\\n• that we will be able to continue to expand Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells to be\\nintegrated into battery modules and finished battery packs and drive unit components for Model 3, including in part to support\\nproduction in China as the level of local sourcing and manufacturing there progressively increases, all at costs that allow us to sell\\nModel 3 at our target gross margins;\\n• that we will be able to build and commence production at additional future facilities, such as at Gigafactory Shanghai, to support our\\ninternational ramp for Model 3 in accordance with our projected costs and timeline;\\n• that the equipment and processes which we have selected for Model 3 production will be able to accurately manufacture high volumes\\nof Model 3 vehicles within specified design tolerances and with high quality;\\n• that we will be able to maintain suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and that we\\nwill be able to obtain high-quality components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities to support high-volume production; and\\n• that we will be able to attract, recruit, hire, train and retain skilled employees to operate our planned high-volume production facilities to\\nsupport Model 3, including at the Tesla Factory, Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\nIf one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect, our ability to meet our Model 3 projections on time and at volumes\\nand prices that are profitable, the demand for and deliveries of Model 3, as well as our business, prospects, operating results and\\nfinancial condition, may be materially and adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production, sales and delivery plans and servicing needs, any of which could harm our\\nbusiness and prospects.\\n\\nOur plans call for sustaining and further ramping from our significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries, particularly for Model\\n3. Our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity\\nto achieve the planned production yield, further install and increase capacity in accordance with our planned timelines and costs, maintain\\nour desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes, as well as our suppliers’ ability to support our needs. In addition,\\nwe have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies, techniques and processes for our vehicles, which\\nwe must successfully introduce and scale for high-volume production. For example, we have introduced highly automated production\\nlines, aluminum spot welding systems and high-speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts. We have also introduced\\nunique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges, such as large display screens, dual motor drivetrain,\\nAutopilot hardware and falcon-wing doors. We have limited experience developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing, and allocating\\nour available resources among, multiple products simultaneously. If we are unable to realize our plans, our brand, business, prospects,\\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially damaged.\\n\\n17\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nConcurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase sales and deliveries of our\\nvehicles. Although we have a plan for selling and delivering increased volumes of vehicles, we have limited experience in marketing,\\nselling and delivering vehicles at the higher volumes at which we are manufacturing Model 3, and we may face difficulties meeting our\\nsales and delivery goals in both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand, such as Europe and China where we are\\nbeginning to deliver Model 3 for the first time in the first quarter of 2019. In particular, we are targeting for the first time with Model 3 a\\nmass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our\\nproducts. While we are producing numerous variants (including regional versions) of Model 3 in accordance with the demand that we\\nexpect for them, if our projections are inaccurate, we may not be able to generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the\\ncapacity to produce, based on vehicle production line constraints and long lead times for procuring certain parts.\\n\\nMoreover, because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers\\nand meeting their vehicle servicing needs. To date, we have limited experience with such deliveries and servicing at the scale to which\\nwe expect to grow, particularly in international markets. To accommodate our volumes, we have deployed a number of delivery models,\\nsuch as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces, some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different\\ngeographies. Moreover, significant transit time may be required to transport vehicles such as Model 3 in volume into new markets for the\\nfirst time. To the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries, our results may be negatively impacted. Finally, because of our\\nunique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers, Mobile Service technicians or\\ncertain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped. If we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity\\nor experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of Model 3, which we recently commenced producing at volume, it could overburden\\nour servicing capabilities. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our sales, delivery and servicing targets globally, or our projections on\\nwhich such targets are based are inaccurate, this could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a material adverse\\neffect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles,\\nespecially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3.\\n\\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular.\\nAlthough we have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far, there is no guarantee of such future demand, or that our vehicles\\nwill not compete with one another in the market. Moreover, the Model 3 mass market demographic is larger, but more competitive, than\\nthe demographic for Model S and Model X, and additional electric vehicles are entering the market.\\n\\nIf the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, or develops more slowly than\\nwe expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\\ncould be harmed. We have only recently begun high volume production of vehicles, are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources\\nrelative to our competitors, and the market for alternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be\\naffected by numerous factors, such as:\\n\\n• perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n• perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\\n• competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal\\ncombustion engine vehicles;\\n• volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\\n• government regulations and economic incentives;\\n• access to charging facilities; and\\n• concerns about our future viability.\\n18\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver\\nnecessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our\\ninability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers, the majority of whom are\\ncurrently single-source suppliers, although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible. Any\\nsignificant increases in our production may require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time, and in the past we\\nhave also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. While we\\nbelieve that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame,\\nthere is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our\\nproducts. Moreover, we have signed long-term agreements with Panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithium-ion\\ncells at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and PV cells and panels at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York. If we encounter unexpected difficulties\\nwith key suppliers such as Panasonic, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production\\ndelays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our products.\\n\\nThis limited, and in many cases single source, supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component\\nshortages for the production of our products, such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our\\nslower-than-planned Model S and Model X ramps. Furthermore, unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor\\nissues, wars, governmental changes, natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and\\nour suppliers’ control, could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. The loss of any single or limited\\nsource supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in\\nproduct deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity, damage to our\\nbrand and a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nChanges in our supply chain have also resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost. We have also experienced\\ncost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to our design\\nchanges, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of supply\\narrangements. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for\\ncertain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to\\ncontrol and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. \\n\\nIn particular, because we are producing Model 3 at significantly higher volumes than any of our other products to date, the negative\\nimpact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than any supply\\nchain-related issues experienced with respect to our other products. We need our Model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp in accordance\\nwith our ongoing ramp of Model 3 and deliver according to our schedule. There is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able\\nto sustainably and timely meet our cost, quality and volume needs. For example, we may experience issues or delays increasing the level\\nof localization in China through local sourcing and manufacturing at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Furthermore, as the scale of our vehicle\\nproduction increases, we will need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components\\nat much higher volumes. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs, or\\nsuccessfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply\\nchain, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which could have a material adverse\\neffect on our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\n19\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFuture problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability\\nof our products, such as Model 3 and our energy storage products.\\n\\nTo lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume, we have vertically integrated the production of lithium-ion cells and\\nfinished battery packs for Model 3 and energy storage products at Gigafactory 1. While Gigafactory 1 began producing lithium-ion cells for\\nenergy storage products in January 2017 and has since begun producing lithium-ion cells for Model 3, we have no other direct experience\\nin the production of lithium-ion cells. Given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in\\nissues or delays in further ramping and expanding production at Gigafactory 1. Moreover, we expect that we will need additional\\nproduction at Gigafactory 1 to support vehicle production at Gigafactory Shanghai in part when we commence Model 3 production there.\\nIn order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage products,\\nwe must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory 1, which, among other things, requires Panasonic to\\nsuccessfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of\\nproducing high-quality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has limited experience with cell production at Gigafactory 1. In\\naddition, we produce several components for Model 3, such as battery modules incorporating the lithium-ion cells produced by\\nPanasonic, and drive units, at Gigafactory 1. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp\\nto their full capacity. While we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semi-automated lines and improving our\\noriginal lines, additional bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the production rate. Finally, we have announced that we will\\nlikely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1. If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory 1 production, ramp additionally over time as\\nneeded, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or Panasonic are unable to attract, hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled\\npersonnel, our ability to supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted,\\nwhich could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIf our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and\\nservices could be harmed.\\n\\nIf our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that\\nrequire repair, or certain features of our vehicles, such as full self-driving, take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally\\nrestricted, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is\\nhighly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks.\\nIssues experienced by vehicle customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof\\nand the 12-volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in\\nour products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not be to the\\nsatisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture, we currently have a\\nlimited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our\\nbattery packs, powertrains, vehicles and energy storage products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any\\ndefects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for consumers.\\n\\nAny product defects, delays or legal restrictions on product features, or other failure of our products to perform as expected, could harm\\nour reputation and result in delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, and significant warranty and other expenses, and\\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\\n\\n20\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIf we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new conditions effectively as we rapidly grow\\nour company, including internationally, we may not be able to produce, market, sell and service our products successfully.\\n\\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial\\ncondition. We expect to continue to expand our operations significantly, including internationally and with our increasing production of\\nModel 3, and the worldwide sales, delivery and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the\\ncoming years. Furthermore, we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide, including in\\ncountries where we have limited or no previous operating experience. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability\\nto manage our expansion and growth successfully. We may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to\\ncontrol expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs, establish sufficient worldwide automobile sales,\\ndelivery, service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner, adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local\\nrequirements, implement required local infrastructure, systems and processes, and find and hire a significant number of additional\\nmanufacturing, engineering, service, electrical installation, construction and administrative personnel.\\n\\nIn particular, we plan to expand our manufacturing capabilities outside of the U.S., where we have limited experience operating a factory\\nor managing related regulatory, financing and other challenges. For example, as part of our continuing work to increase Model 3\\nproduction to 10,000 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and make Model 3 affordable in the markets where we plan to offer it, we\\nexpect to commence the initial phase of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai for the local market in China by the end of 2019,\\nalthough the timeframe for that is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the\\npace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online. As we expect to commence our manufacturing activities in China\\nusing progressively increased levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing, we expect that we will need to initially\\nsupport manufacturing activities there with production processes at our existing manufacturing facilities, such as Gigafactory 1. Moreover,\\nlocal manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sales in China, which is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world. Our sales\\nof Model S and Model X in China have been negatively impacted by certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the U.S., such as our\\nvehicles, and our costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced\\nfrom China. If we are not able to establish manufacturing activities in China and other jurisdictions to minimize the impact of such\\nunfavorable tariffs, duties or costs, or ramp our production capabilities at Gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle\\nmanufacturing activities, our ability to compete in such jurisdictions, and our operating results, business and prospects, will be harmed.\\n\\nIf we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles, including Model 3, our financial condition and operating\\nresults will suffer.\\n\\nWhile we are continuing to and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers, there is no guarantee we will\\nbe able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals, including for the least expensive variant of\\nModel 3 that we ultimately expect to produce, or our other financial targets. We incur significant costs related to procuring the materials\\nrequired to manufacture our vehicles, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. If our efforts to continue to decrease\\nmanufacturing costs are not successful, we may incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production\\ncapability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities, such as for Model 3 both in the U.S. and internationally. Many of the factors that impact\\nour manufacturing costs are beyond our control, such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components, such as\\nlithium, nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels. If we are unable to continue to control\\nand reduce our manufacturing costs, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed.\\n\\n21\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, in particular for lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.\\n\\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials. Any such increase, supply\\ninterruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use\\nvarious materials in our business including aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers.\\nThe prices for these materials fluctuate, and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand\\nfor these materials, including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors, and\\ncould adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells.\\nThese risks include:\\n\\n• an increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply, of materials used in the cells;\\n• disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers or any issues that may arise with respect to\\ncells manufactured at our own facilities; and\\n• fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery-cell purchases for Model S and Model X and some\\nraw materials for cells used in Model 3 and energy storage products are currently denominated in Japanese yen. \\n\\nOur business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage\\nproducts. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, and expect to eventually rely\\nsubstantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities, we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for\\nthe cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells\\nfrom such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a\\ndifferent supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to\\nexperience significant increases in freight charges and material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices\\ncharged to us, such as those charged by battery cell suppliers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we\\ncannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased\\nmaterial costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand,\\nimage, business, prospects and operating results.\\n\\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully\\ndefend or insure against such claims.\\n\\nAlthough we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road, product liability claims, even those without merit, could harm our\\nbusiness, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product\\nliability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have\\nperformed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in\\ncrashes resulting in death or personal injury, and such crashes where Autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention.\\nWe have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of new technologies\\nthat we are pioneering, including Autopilot in our vehicles. Moreover, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate\\nand store electricity, they have the potential to cause injury to people or property. A successful product liability claim against us could\\nrequire us to pay a substantial monetary award. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of\\nvehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. Moreover, a product liability claim\\ncould generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand,\\nbusiness, prospects and operating results. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for\\nvehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds, not by insurance.\\n\\n22\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently\\nface competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the\\nfuture, including competition from companies with new technology.\\n\\nThe worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even\\nmore so in the future. There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete. A\\nsignificant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered or are\\nreported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the\\nmarket for self-driving technology and applications. In some cases, such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric\\nvehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial,\\ntechnical, manufacturing, marketing, vehicle sales resources and networks than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to\\nthe design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.  In particular, some competitors have\\nalso announced plans to compete with us in important and large markets for electric vehicles, such as China. Increased competition could\\nresult in lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our\\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our Model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future\\nautomobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.\\n\\nThe solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive. We face competition from other manufacturers, developers and installers\\nof solar and energy storage systems, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other\\nrenewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under\\nour existing long-term leases and PPAs. Moreover, solar panel and lithium-ion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline.\\nAs we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities, including at Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2, future price declines may\\nharm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices.\\n\\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our\\nindustries, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially.\\n\\nConsumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and\\nsupport and other operations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and\\nresources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to\\nbuild and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, ratings agencies and other parties\\nin our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain\\nfactors, such as our limited operating history, negative press, customer unfamiliarity with our products, any delays in scaling\\nmanufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or\\nour other products and services, our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations, and any other\\nnegative publicity related to us. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term\\nbusiness prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management\\nteam, could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\\n\\n23\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOur plan to generate ongoing growth and demand, including by expanding and optimizing our retail, service and vehicle charging\\noperations, will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to\\nadditional sales, installations or servicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions.\\n\\nWe plan to generate ongoing growth and demand, including by globally expanding and optimizing our retail, service and vehicle charging\\noperations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with\\nrespect to additional sales or installations of our products. This ongoing global expansion, which includes planned entry into markets in\\nwhich we have limited or no experience selling, delivering, installing and/or servicing our products at scale, and which may pose legal,\\nregulatory, labor, cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered, may not have the desired effect of increasing\\nsales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore, the increasing number of Tesla\\nvehicles will require us to continue to increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors significantly in locations\\nthroughout the world. If we fail to do so in a timely manner, our customers could become dissatisfied, which could adversely affect sales\\nof our vehicles. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale, installation and\\nservice of our products, the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those\\njurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in\\nexpanding our customer infrastructure network, or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand, this could lead\\nto a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\n\\nWe face risks associated with our global operations and expansion, including unfavorable regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor\\nconditions, and with establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our business.\\n\\nWe currently have a global footprint, with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions,\\nand we continue to expand and optimize our retail, service and Supercharger capabilities internationally. Accordingly, we are subject to a\\nvariety of legal, political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions over which we have little control. For example,\\nwe may be impacted by trade policies, political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant\\noperations. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased\\nvolatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies.\\n\\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated in particular with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our\\nability to sell our products and require significant management attention. These risks include conforming our products to various\\ninternational regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures, organizing local operating entities,\\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, challenges in attracting customers, foreign government taxes,\\nregulations and permit requirements, our ability to enforce our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price\\nor exchange controls, and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, in China, which is a key\\nmarket for us, certain products such as automobiles manufactured in the U.S. have become subject to a recently increased tariff imposed\\nby the government. While such increase has been temporarily suspended, the tariff could remain in place for an undetermined length of\\ntime, be further increased in the future and/or lead consumers to postpone or choose another vehicle brand subject to lower tariffs or no\\ntariffs. Moreover, recently increased import duties on certain components used in our products that are sourced from China may increase\\nour costs and negatively impact our operating results.\\n\\n24\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOur vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke\\nand flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in\\nautomotive applications.\\n\\nThe battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they\\ncontain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have\\ndesigned the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no\\nassurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could subject us to\\nlawsuits, product recalls or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions\\nregarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or\\nother fire, even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products, could seriously harm our business.\\n\\nIn addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our facilities and are producing high volumes of cells and battery modules\\nand packs at Gigafactory 1. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have\\nimplemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the\\ncells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any\\nfailure of a competitor’s electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products. Such\\nadverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIf we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual, financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs, our business\\nmay suffer.\\n\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We\\nalso currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada. Under a lease held\\ndirectly by us, we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of\\npayments over the term of the lease. The profitability of any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to\\naccurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms\\ndepending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. The\\nleasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners to fund and grow this program, and\\nscreen for and manage customer credit risk. We expect the availability of leasing and other financing options will be important for our\\nvehicle customers. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds, or partners or other external financing\\nsources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers, we may be unable to grow our sales.\\nFurthermore, if our leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of\\nresidual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or\\nlocal financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or\\npenalties, either of which may harm our business.\\n\\nMoreover, we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such\\ncounterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values, as\\nwith residual values for leased vehicles, are subject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements. If the actual resale\\nvalues of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we\\nhave offered, our operating results, profitability and/or liquidity could be negatively impacted.\\n\\n25\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or unfavorable determinations with respect to, government and economic incentives in the\\nU.S. and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles, energy storage products or solar energy could have some\\nimpact on demand for our products and services.\\n\\nWe and our customers currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of\\nelectric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase\\nof electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, the 25% value added\\ntax, or the carbon dioxide and weight-based purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of\\nincentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles\\nthrough the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or\\nexhausted. For example, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit that was available in the U.S. for the purchase of our\\nvehicles is being reduced in phases during, and will sunset at the end of, 2019. We believe the first reduction in this tax credit may have\\npulled forward some near-term demand in the U.S. into 2018, and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 before each further step\\nreduction in the federal tax credit. Moreover, in July 2018, a previously available incentive for purchases of Model 3 in Ontario, Canada\\nwas cancelled and Tesla buyers in Germany lost access to electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017. In\\nApril 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of\\nelectric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Effective March 2016, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash\\nrebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers. Such developments could have some negative impact on demand for our\\nvehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them.\\n\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar\\nand energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our\\nproducts and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date when the\\nallocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, often without warning. For example,\\nthe U.S. federal government currently offers a 30% ITC for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are\\ncharged from a co-sited solar power facility. The ITC is currently scheduled to decline in phases, ultimately to 10% for commercial and\\nutility systems and to 0% for customer-owned residential systems by January 2022. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net energy metering\\nis currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the\\ngrid in excess of the electric load they use. Several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy\\nmetering, or have proposed to do so. Such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by\\nmaking our products less competitive for potential customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract\\ninvestment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets. Additionally, the enactment of the Tax Cuts\\nand Jobs Act in the U.S. could potentially increase the cost, and decrease the availability, of renewable energy financing, by reducing the\\nvalue of depreciation benefits associated with, and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize, renewable energy projects. Such\\nchanges could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market.\\n\\nMoreover, we and our fund investors claim the ITC and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar\\nand energy storage systems. Although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values, the relevant\\ngovernmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower, and they may do so\\nagain in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other\\npayments to our funds or fund investors.\\n\\n26\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAny failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of PV\\ncells and modules, including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State\\nUniversity of New York relating to our Gigafactory 2, could result in negative consequences for our business.\\n\\nWe own certain PV cell and module manufacturing and technology assets, and a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research\\nFoundation for the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”). This agreement with the SUNY Foundation provides for the\\nconstruction of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York with the intended capacity to produce at least 1.0 GW of solar products annually.\\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New\\nYork and spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New\\nYork during the 10-year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure, the arrival of manufacturing\\nequipment, and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at Gigafactory 2. If we fail in any year over the course of the term\\nof the agreement to meet these obligations, we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation\\nin such year. Any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts\\nto the SUNY Foundation, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2, and/or the need to secure an alternative supply of PV cells and\\nmodules for our solar products. Moreover, if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology assets in accordance with our\\nexpectations, we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the write-off of such assets. Any of the foregoing events could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIf we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\\n\\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles\\nand services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services\\nof Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jeffrey B. Straubel, our Chief Technology Officer.\\n\\nNone of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract\\nand retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive\\nofficers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel, especially to support our\\nhigh-volume manufacture of vehicles and expansion plans, and any failure or delay in doing so could adversely impact our business,\\nprospects, financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nKey talent may leave Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or\\ntechnology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In California, Nevada and other regions where we have operations, there is\\nincreasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software\\nengineering, manufacturing engineering, and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise. This competition affects\\nboth our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. Moreover, we have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to\\noptimize our organizational structure and reduce costs, and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reasons. Our\\ncontinued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner, especially to support our expansion\\nplans, and to retain current employees or replace departed senior employees with qualified and experienced individuals, which is typically\\na time-consuming process. Additionally, we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial\\nresources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities. Difficulties in retaining current\\nemployees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance and results.\\n\\n27\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and\\nbenefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Each of our current equity incentive plan\\nand employee stock purchase plan provides for an “evergreen” provision that permits our board of directors to increase on an annual\\nbasis, subject to specified limits, the number of equity-based awards that may be granted to, and shares of our common stock that may\\nbe purchased by, our personnel thereunder. These plans are currently scheduled to expire in December 2019, and we will need to extend\\nthem or establish new plans in order to continue to compensate our employees following their expiration, which will require the approval\\nof our stockholders. Moreover, there is no assurance that these plans as extended or any future plans will contain evergreen provisions,\\nwhich would mean that we would have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number\\nof awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased under such plans. If we are unable to obtain such stockholder\\napprovals and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy, our ability to retain and hire qualified\\npersonnel would be negatively impacted.\\n\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.\\n\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends\\nsignificant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also\\ncurrently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and\\nmanufacturer of space launch vehicles, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\\n\\nWe are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our\\nsystems against breaches and cyber-attacks. If these efforts are not successful, our business and operations could be disrupted and our\\noperating results and reputation could be harmed.\\n\\nWe are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed\\nsystems, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued\\ndevelopment, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the U.S. and abroad, which include product data\\nmanagement, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management,\\nfinancial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. We also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against\\nintellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber-attacks. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems\\nrequire significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and\\nexpanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement,\\nmanufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data\\nand inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or\\nrealize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\\n\\nWe cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned.\\nIf we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to\\naccurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial\\nreporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information could be compromised or\\nmisappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them\\nto, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\\n\\n28\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products and harm our\\nbusiness.\\n\\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with\\nbuilt-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. We have designed,\\nimplemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our\\nproducts and their systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to\\nmodify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and\\nperformance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential\\nvulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified\\nvulnerability. Accordingly, we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them. However,\\nthere can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified, or that our remediation\\nefforts are or will be successful.\\n\\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In\\naddition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that\\nmay result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being “hacked,” could negatively affect our brand and\\nharm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\\n\\nWe are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively\\nimpact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities.\\n\\nAs a manufacturing company, including with respect to facilities such as the Tesla Factory, Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2, we are\\nsubject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S. and abroad,\\nincluding laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. The costs of compliance,\\nincluding remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended\\nlaws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection\\nwith our manufacturing facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs and delays may adversely impact our\\nbusiness prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties,\\nremediation costs, third party damages, or a suspension or cessation of our operations.\\n\\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\\n\\nIt is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union, which can result in\\nhigher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate\\nemployee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the\\nrelevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may\\nstill decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. The United Automobile\\nWorkers (“UAW”) has been engaged in a campaign to organize manufacturing operations at Tesla. As part of that campaign, the UAW\\nhas filed with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) a series of unfair labor practice charges against Tesla on which a hearing\\nrecently concluded. We cannot predict the timing of the NLRB’s decision, and an unfavorable outcome for Tesla may have a negative\\nimpact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies\\nwith unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such\\nunions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could\\ndelay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or\\nfinancial condition.\\n\\n29\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOur products and services are subject to substantial regulations, which are evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply\\nwith these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\\n\\nMotor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. We incur significant costs in\\ncomplying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations, and any\\nfailures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. We are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply,\\nmanufacture, import, sale and service of automobiles internationally. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to\\nmeet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions, among other things, that are often materially different from\\nrequirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those\\ncountries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as\\nwell as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\n\\nAdditionally, our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driver-assistance features called Autopilot, which help assist drivers with certain\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but require drivers to remain engaged. There is a variety of international, federal\\nand state regulations that may apply to self-driving vehicles, which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally\\nintended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a\\npatchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay products or restrict self-driving features and availability, any of which could\\nadversely affect our business.\\n\\nMoreover, as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and\\nstored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations\\nand policies concerning electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid, and\\nthe sale of electricity generated by third-party owned systems. For example, existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit\\nutilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems, charge fees and penalties to our\\ncustomers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid, adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar\\nproducts may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid, restrict us and our customers from transacting under our PPAs or\\nqualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power, and limit or eliminate net energy metering. If such regulations\\nand policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions, or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the\\ninterconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our\\nsolar and energy storage products, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage\\nsystem sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\n\\nFailure to comply with various privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject could harm the Company.\\n\\nOur privacy policy is posted on our website, and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with\\nfederal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions\\nagainst us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection\\nwith maintaining compliance with such laws, and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of\\nuncertainty as to their interpretation and application. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”)\\nbegan to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union. The GDPR has\\ncreated new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Although we take steps to protect the\\nsecurity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach\\nrequirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss\\nwith respect to customers’ personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences\\nfor our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles and\\nharm to our reputation and brand.\\n\\n30\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions, which could adversely affect our brand\\nimage and financial performance.\\n\\nAny product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business,\\nprospects, operating results and financial condition. For example, certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted from various\\ncauses, including a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged, a concern with the firmware in the\\nrestraints control module in certain right-hand-drive vehicles, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular supplier, Model X seat\\ncomponents that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision, and concerns of corrosion in Model S power steering assist\\nmotor bolts. Furthermore, testing of our products by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate product recalls or\\nmay result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or\\ninvoluntarily, initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle\\nOEMs, including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers, prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and\\nregulations, such as federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or\\ncomponents engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand\\nimage in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial\\nperformance.\\n\\nSubject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system, battery and drive unit, we provide four-year or 50,000-mile\\nlimited warranties for the purchasers of new Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles and either a four-year or 50,000-mile limited\\nwarranty or a two-year or 100,000-mile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchasers of used Model S or Model X vehicles\\ncertified and sold by us. The limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new Model S and Model X vehicles covers the drive unit for\\neight years, as well as the battery for a period of eight years (or for certain older vehicles, 125,000 miles if reached sooner than eight\\nyears), although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or Extended Service plans; the limited\\nwarranty for used Model S and Model X vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited\\nwarranty for such used vehicles specified in their original New Vehicle Limited Warranty. For the battery and drive unit on our current new\\nModel 3 vehicles, we offer an eight-year or 100,000-mile limited warranty for our standard or mid-range battery and an eight-year or\\n120,000-mile limited warranty for our long-range battery, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty period. In\\naddition, customers of new Model S and Model X vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after\\nthe end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50,000 miles.\\n\\nFor energy storage products, we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels. For\\nexample, we currently guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 70 or 80% (depending on the region of installation)\\nof its stated energy capacity after 10 years, and that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of\\nits first 15 years of use. For our Solar Roof, we currently offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customer’s home and a\\nseparate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles. We also offer extended warranties, availability guarantees and\\ncapacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase, as well as workmanship warranties to\\ncustomers who elect to have us install their systems.\\n\\nFinally, customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs are covered by warranties equal to the\\nlength of the agreement term, which is typically 20 years. Systems purchased for cash are covered by a workmanship warranty of up to\\n20 years. In addition, we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties, which generally range from 10\\nto 25 years. Finally, we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an\\nannual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease.  Under these performance\\nguarantees, we bear the risk of production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure.  These risks are exacerbated in the event\\nthe panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\\n\\n31\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our business, prospects, financial condition and\\noperating results could be materially and adversely affected. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimate of the projected\\ncosts to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the\\nnature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected\\nexperience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3 and Solar Roof that we have recently introduced and/or that we expect to\\nproduce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\n\\nOur insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\n\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims\\nagainst us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as\\nmany other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include\\nsignificant deductibles or self-insured retentions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future\\nlosses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which\\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\\n\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at\\nwhich we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current\\nmanufacturing facilities and adding future facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai may not be consistent or linear between periods.\\nAdditionally, our revenues from period-to-period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as\\nwe develop and introduce new products.  As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial\\nresults, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of\\nfuture performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors,\\nwho may be focused only on quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either\\nsuddenly or over time.\\n\\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our\\nbusiness to pay our substantial indebtedness.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $11.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see\\nNote 13, Long-Term Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\\nOur substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We\\nand our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure\\nexisting or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\\n\\nPursuant to their terms, holders of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019, 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 and 2.375%\\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2022 (collectively, the “Tesla Convertible Notes”) may convert their respective Tesla Convertible Notes at\\ntheir option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective Tesla Convertible Notes under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of\\nthe applicable Tesla Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and\\nthe conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible Notes. Moreover, our subsidiary’s 1.625%\\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2019 and Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (together, the “Subsidiary Convertible Notes”)\\nare convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from $300.00 to $759.36 per share. Finally, holders of the\\nTesla Convertible Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the\\noccurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid\\ninterest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date.\\n\\n32\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon\\nconversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes, or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire,\\ndepends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our\\nbusiness may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing\\nindebtedness, and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such\\ncash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures,\\nselling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance\\nexisting or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to make\\npayments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not be able to\\nengage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which could result in a default on our existing or\\nfuture indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\\n\\nThe terms of certain of our credit facilities, including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement, contain, and any of our\\nother future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our\\nability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock or make other restricted\\npayments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply\\nwith a fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions\\nand engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to\\ncomply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our\\nobligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\\n\\nWe may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise\\nadditional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\\n\\nThe design, manufacture, sale, installation and/or servicing of automobiles, energy storage products and solar products is a capital\\nintensive business, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. Until we are\\nconsistently generating positive free cash flows, we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,\\nequity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of\\nliquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles, energy storage products and/or solar products, to pay\\nany significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated\\nindebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations,\\nramp vehicle production, continue research and development projects, establish sales, delivery and service centers, build and deploy\\nSuperchargers, expand Gigafactory 1, ramp production at Gigafactory 2, build and commence Model 3 production at Gigafactory\\nShanghai and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles, energy storage products\\nand solar products. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we\\ncannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be\\nmaterially and adversely affected.\\n\\n33\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAdditionally, we use capital from third-party investors to enable our customers’ access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront\\ncost. The availability of this financing depends upon many factors, including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry,\\nthe quality and mix of our customer contracts, any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts,\\nchanges in law (including tax law), risks or government incentives associated with these financings, and our ability to compete with other\\nrenewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors. Moreover, while interest rates remain at low levels, they have\\nrisen in recent periods. If the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce the present value\\nof the customer payment streams underlying, and therefore the total value of, our financing structures, increasing our cost of capital. If we\\nare unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for third-party ownership arrangements, we may be unable to finance the\\ninstallation of our solar energy systems for our lease or PPA customers’ systems, or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity\\nmay be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental\\ninvestigations and proceedings.\\n\\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the\\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Aside from the settlement with the SEC\\ndiscussed below relating to Elon Musk’s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, to our knowledge no government agency\\nin any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\\nongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse\\nconsequences if the SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to\\nincur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental\\nproceedings.\\n\\nFor example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the\\nterms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s\\nstatement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a\\ncivil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the Chair of the Board, appointed two additional independent directors to\\nthe Board, and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. Although we\\nintend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance, additional enforcement\\nactions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.\\n\\nIf we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected, we may have to shorten the useful lives\\nof any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update, and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect\\nour financial results.\\n\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling, machinery and other\\nmanufacturing equipment for our various product lines, and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives.\\nHowever, manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly, and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cutting-edge\\nequipment more quickly than expected. Moreover, we are continually implementing learnings as our engineering and manufacturing\\nexpertise and efficiency increase, which may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed\\nequipment. Alternatively, as we ramp production of Model 3 to higher levels, our learnings may cause us to discontinue the use of already\\ninstalled equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result\\nwould be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations could be negatively\\nimpacted.\\n\\n34\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial results.\\n\\nOur revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. As we have increased vehicle deliveries in\\nmarkets outside of the U.S., we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro, Canadian\\ndollar, Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S.\\ndollars, as we have historically experienced. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue\\nto be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if\\nthe value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our\\nrevenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to\\noffset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results\\ncould be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our\\nelectric vehicles.\\n\\nWe sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach, currently including through our website\\nand our own stores. While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, we may not be able to sell our vehicles\\nthrough our own stores in each state in the U.S., as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this\\ndirect-to-consumer sales model. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have opened galleries, which are\\nnot full sales locations.\\n\\nThe application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to\\nobtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so.\\n\\nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such\\ndecisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have\\nreinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. In some states, there have also been\\nregulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses\\nin their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time\\nlimits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. We have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Michigan\\nchallenging the constitutionality of the state’s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business.\\n\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that\\nmay restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex,\\ndifficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell\\nvehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\n\\nWe may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to\\nincur substantial costs.\\n\\nOthers, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit\\nor interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to\\noperate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take\\nlicenses, and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights. We may consider the entering into licensing\\nagreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or\\nthat litigation will not occur, and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, if we are determined to\\nhave infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain\\ncomponents or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign\\nour products and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we were\\nrequired to take one or more such actions, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely\\naffected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of\\nresources and management attention.\\n\\n35\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nTesla is a highly-visible public company whose products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are often scrutinized by\\ncritics whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock.\\n\\nTesla is a highly-visible public company whose products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are well-publicized.\\nSuch attention includes frequent criticism of us by a range of third-parties. Our continued success depends on our ability to focus on\\nexecuting on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers, employees, stockholders\\nand business partners. Any negative perceived actions of ours could influence the perception of our brand or our leadership by our\\ncustomers, suppliers or investors, which could adversely impact our business prospects, operating results and the market value of our\\ncommon stock.\\n\\nOur facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters.\\n\\nOur corporate headquarters, the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and\\nNevada. If major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks\\ndown or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay\\nproduction and shipment of our products. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact\\non our business, operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\n\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\\n\\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to\\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $387.46 per share\\nand a low of $244.59 per share over the last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in\\nparticular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\\nperformance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short\\nsellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public\\nperception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a\\ndisproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of\\nvolatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been\\ninstituted against these companies. Moreover, stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past. While we are continuing\\nto defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a\\ndiversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\n\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to\\ndecline.\\n\\nWe provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as\\nwell as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business\\nconditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate. Our guidance\\nis based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear\\nthroughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs, and planned cost reductions. If our guidance is not\\naccurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could\\noccur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\\n\\n36\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nTransactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the\\nprice of our common stock.\\n\\nThe conversion of some or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interests of\\nexisting stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes. Our Subsidiary Convertible Notes have been\\nhistorically, and the other Tesla Convertible Notes may become in the future, convertible at the option of their holders prior to their\\nscheduled terms under certain circumstances. If holders elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required to deliver to them a\\nsignificant number of shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion\\ncould adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage\\nshort selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated\\nconversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\\n\\nMoreover, in connection with each issuance of the Tesla Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which\\nare expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal\\namount upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge\\ncounterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our\\ncommon stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates. In addition, the hedge counterparties\\nor their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions, which could also cause or prevent an increase\\nor a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes.\\n\\nElon Musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings. If Mr. Musk were forced to sell these shares\\npursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\\n\\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to\\npurchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party\\nparticipants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the\\nTesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and Mr. Musk were\\nunable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking\\ninstitutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans.\\nAny such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\\n\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover\\nattempt.\\n\\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or\\nprevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and\\nother provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In\\naddition, the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a\\ntakeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could\\nlimit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that\\nsome investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\\n\\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes\\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nOverview and 2018 Highlights\\n\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell\\nhigh-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,\\ninstallation, operation and other services related to our products.\\n\\nAutomotive\\n\\nOur production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV, which are our highest-performance vehicles,\\nand our Model 3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced\\nAutopilot options, internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance\\nfeatures. In addition, we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including Model Y, Tesla Semi, a pickup truck and a\\nnew version of the Tesla Roadster.\\n\\nIn 2018, we continued to scale our automotive operations, particularly our ramp of Model 3, and achieved total production of 254,530\\nvehicles and delivered 245,506 vehicles, representing year-over-year increases of approximately 152% and 138%, respectively.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\n\\nWe lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers, and are\\nramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive, integrated styling. Our energy storage products,\\nwhich we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for commercial,\\nindustrial and utility-scale applications.\\n\\nDuring 2018, we deployed 1.04 GWh of energy storage products, nearly tripling our 358 MWh of energy storage deployments during\\n2017. We also deployed 326 megawatts (“MW”) of solar energy generation during 2018.\\n\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2019 Outlook\\n\\nAutomotive Demand, Production and Deliveries\\n\\nOur goal is to produce the world’s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible with a priority on workplace\\nhealth and safety. The worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and self-driving technology are highly competitive and\\nwe expect them to become even more so. A growing number of companies, including established automakers, have announced plans to\\nexpand, and in some cases fully transition to, production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles, and/or to develop self-driving\\ntechnologies. However, we believe that the unique features of our vehicles, the safety aspects of each of our vehicles, our constant\\ninnovation, our growing brand, the increased affordability introduced with Model 3, the innovation and expansion of our global retail,\\nservice and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles\\nby making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets.\\n\\n42\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nModel 3 was the best-selling premium vehicle in the United States in 2018. Vehicles traded in to us by Model 3 customers continue to\\nsuggest the existence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of mid-sized premium sedans. Moreover, as we\\nhave offered only the long-range, mid-range and performance variants of Model 3 thus far, we believe that we will see increased demand\\nwith the introduction of less expensive variants, such as a version with a base price of $35,000 that we intend to offer in the future, and\\nadditional financing options. We commenced in January 2019 production of Model 3 for Europe and China, each of which we believe has\\na much larger mid-sized premium sedan market than North America, where we have exclusively delivered Model 3 to date. We also\\nbelieve that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain technology, as our vehicles’\\nEPA-rated range per kWh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term, and we have the\\nability to improve our vehicles through over-the-air software updates. We are producing variants (including regional versions) of Model 3\\nin accordance with the demand that we expect for them, however, and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times\\nassociated with procuring certain parts. If our Model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing\\nplanned additional variants, including as we begin offering Model 3 in new markets, we may not be able to timely generate sales matched\\nto the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce. We may also be impacted by trade policies, political uncertainty and\\neconomic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also\\ntend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail\\nstrategies. In addition, the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the U.S. was reduced to $3,750 for any Tesla\\nvehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019, and will be further reduced to $1,875 for each Tesla vehicle delivered in the\\nthird or fourth quarter of 2019 and to $0 for each Tesla vehicle delivered thereafter. We believe that this phase-out likely pulled forward\\nsome vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pull-forwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit.\\nIn the long run, we do not expect a meaningful impact to our sales in the U.S., as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a\\ncompelling proposition even without incentives. Globally, we are also working to, and in some cases have already begun to, increase the\\nvalue proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing arrangements over time. For example, we intend\\nto introduce leasing options for Model 3.\\n\\nOur Model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018, and we expect to continue to grow Model 3 production to a sustained rate of\\n7,000 vehicles per week at our Tesla Factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries.  We remain focused on further cost\\nimprovements and on increasing the affordability of Model 3. Furthermore, in January 2019 we commenced construction of our\\nGigafactory Shanghai in China. We expect to build a production process that is optimized and simplified for Model 3 production,\\ncomprised of stamping, body joining and paint shops and general assembly, at Gigafactory Shanghai to begin production of certain trims\\nof Model 3 for China by the end of 2019. We believe that the efficiencies of local production, as well as avoiding certain tariffs on\\nU.S.-manufactured vehicles, will allow us to offer Model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicles in the\\nworld. Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai, our goal is to be able to produce 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis, and\\nan annualized output rate in excess of 500,000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of\\n2020. However, the timeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply\\nchain constraints, and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online. Ultimately, achieving increased Model 3\\nproduction cost-effectively will require that we timely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp, and\\nestablish sustained supplier capacity, including locally at Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\nWe also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kWh versions of Model S and Model X to focus on longer range versions of\\nour highest-performance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from Model 3. We have gradually increased the level of option\\nstandardization across these models, and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the\\nproduction hours for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output as necessary. As Model S and Model X are produced in the\\nU.S., for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties on components sourced from China, as well as by tariffs\\non vehicles exported to China, although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to North America and Europe, if necessary.\\n\\n43\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAdvancing our customer-facing infrastructure remains a top priority. Delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were\\nchallenging during 2018, but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction, including by purchasing our own\\ncar-hauling trucks. We are also expanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet, including by growing\\nour service locations and Mobile Service fleet, moving to two-shift operations at service centers where needed, and optimizing our parts\\ndistribution network. We are also updating the Tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments in order to increase customer\\nconvenience. As sales of Tesla vehicles ramp further, we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail locations, service centers and body\\nshops around the world, and we plan to continue to expand our Mobile Service fleet. We also plan to continue to significantly increase the\\nnumber of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally, as well as evolve our Supercharger technology to enable faster\\ncharging times while reducing our related costs. However, we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver\\nan increasing number of vehicles, and we have only limited experience with this at scale, particularly in markets outside of North America.\\nMoreover, if our growing fleet of customer vehicles, particularly Model 3, experiences unexpected reliability issues, it could overburden\\nour servicing capabilities.\\n\\nFinally, we are making progress with our self-driving technology, as well as the Autopilot features in our vehicles. Our neural net and\\nfunctionality continue to improve, and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates.\\nRecently, we launched a “Navigate on Autopilot” feature that allows enabled Tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver\\ninput to change lanes, transition between freeways and exit freeways. While we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have\\nno control, our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy.  Additionally, there is growing competition from other automobile and technology\\ncompanies in the area of self-driving.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\n\\nWe are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products, transitioning away from former channel\\npartners and shifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in Tesla stores and on our website and through cross-selling\\nopportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners.  As we continue to implement this strategy, we expect that our retrofit solar\\nsystem deployments will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year, including through cross-selling\\nopportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners. Our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront\\ncash generation and profitability, rather than absolute volume growth, such as by reducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing\\nresidential installations that are combined with our energy storage products.\\n\\nWe are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product, and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with\\nthe expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019.\\n\\nWe expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth, and we are targeting to more than double our\\ndeployments to over 2 GWh in 2019. We see opportunities in North America as well as in Australia and Europe, where energy storage\\ncoupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates, as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability. We\\nare continuing to ramp production for these products at Gigafactory 1, including through a new production line, and we have seen further\\nmanufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp.\\n\\nTrends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses\\n\\nCapital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately $2.5 billion, mostly to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at\\nGigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai, and the addition of\\nmanufacturing capacity for Model Y, which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020, as well as the ongoing expansion of our\\nretail locations, service centers, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger stations.\\n\\nGenerally, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected\\nrevenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency. In addition, due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational\\nefficiency, we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10% from 2018.\\n\\n44\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving\\nmarket capitalization and operational milestones (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). Consequently, we may incur significant additional\\nnon-cash stock-based compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting.\\n\\nAutomotive Financing Options\\n\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial\\ninstitutions. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance\\ntheir vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with\\nautomotive sales to certain leasing partners. Currently, both programs are available only in certain international markets. Resale value\\nguarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31, 2018 totaled $149.7 million in value.\\n\\nWe have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This impacts the way we account for vehicle\\nsales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now generally qualify to be accounted for as\\nsales with a right of return. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing\\npartners prior to 2018, we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to\\nequity under the modified retrospective approach.\\n\\nVehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount\\nof cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the\\noption to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower\\nthan our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used\\nvehicles in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. To date, we have only had an insignificant number of\\ncustomers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us. Based on current market demand for our\\nvehicles, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts, but resale prices\\nmay inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing\\nof new vehicles. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially.\\n\\nWe currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada. We also offer leasing\\nthrough leasing partners in certain jurisdictions. Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to\\nresidual value risk. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities, we assume customer credit risk. We plan to\\ncontinue expanding our financing offerings, including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to\\nsupport the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on\\nterms that are attractive, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Financing Options\\n\\nWe offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy\\nsystems produce through various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and PPAs. In both\\nstructures, we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee. In the lease structure,\\nthis monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee. In the PPA structure, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour,\\nor kWh, based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces. The leases and PPAs are typically for 20 years\\nwith a renewal option, and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations.\\n\\nFor customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems, we also offer solar loans, whereby a third-party lender provides\\nfinancing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed, installed and\\nserviced by us. We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer. Separately, the\\ncustomer enters into a loan agreement with a third-party lender, who finances the full purchase price. We are not a party to the loan\\nagreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the\\nloan.\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nGigafactory 1\\n\\nWe continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material,\\ncells, modules, battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products. We also continue to invest in the\\nfuture expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there. For example, we have announced that we will likely\\nmanufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1.\\n\\nPanasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply\\nus with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at\\nnegotiated prices. As these terms convey to us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, Leases, their production equipment, we consider\\nthem to be leased assets when production commences. This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within\\nproperty, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations.\\nFor all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we\\nwill apply similar accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $766.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nWhile we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate ability to do so will\\nrequire us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp. For example, we have in the past experienced\\nbottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory 1, which negatively affected our production of Model 3. While we continue\\nto resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1 as they arise, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events\\ncould result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to\\nexpand than we currently anticipate.\\n\\nGigafactory 2\\n\\nWe have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 1.0 GW\\nof solar products annually in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into an agreement with\\nPanasonic under which it manufactures custom PV cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and we purchase certain\\nquantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10-year term.\\n\\nThe terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants, and any failure to comply with\\nthese covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the\\nagreement. Although we remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility,\\nacquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to\\nsignificant expenses to achieve the desired benefits.\\n\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\n\\nWe are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing\\ntransportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S. We broke ground in January\\n2019, and subject to a number of uncertainties, including regulatory approval, supply chain constraints, and the pace of installing\\nproduction equipment and bringing the factory online, we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai\\nby the end of 2019. We expect much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing, supported by\\nlimited direct capital expenditures by us. Moreover, we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory\\nto be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory, from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify\\nour manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\nOther Manufacturing\\n\\nWe continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities, and continually explore additional\\nproduction capacity internationally.\\n\\n46\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\\nof assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as\\nappropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting\\nestimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates\\nmade by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material\\ndifferences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of\\noperations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment\\nand complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding\\nand evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nAdoption of new revenue standard\\n\\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the modified\\nretrospective method. The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion,\\nrefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\n\\nAutomotive Segment\\n\\nAutomotive Sales Revenue\\n\\nAutomotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\\n\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the\\ndefinition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet\\nconnectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the\\ncustomer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance\\nwith payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet\\nconnectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a\\nstraight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these\\nother features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year\\nlife of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer.\\nFor our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\n\\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable\\nconsideration related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods\\npresented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as\\nan offset against automotive sales revenue.\\n\\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on\\nother obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software\\nupdates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we have\\nelected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer\\nas an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive\\ncontracts.\\n\\n47\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAutomotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee\\n\\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance\\ntheir vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with\\nautomotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of\\ndelivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at\\nthe end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.\\n\\nWith the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we now recognize revenue when control\\ntransfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe\\nthe customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine\\nwhether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is\\nexercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations\\nand the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value\\nguarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value\\nguarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. The two programs that are\\nstill being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value\\nGuarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.\\n\\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The\\namount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain\\ntransactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases, we also accrued\\ninterest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\\nthe stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period\\nor the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles,\\nnet, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\\n\\nIn cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value\\nguarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and\\nthe net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to\\nus during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and\\nsettled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the\\nconsolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.\\n\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\n\\nCalifornia and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for\\nsale in that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of\\nzero-emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits (“ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such\\ncredits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to\\ngreenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a\\nmanufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits, on our vehicles, and we\\nexpect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third-parties to purchase our regulatory\\ncredits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with\\npayment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory\\ncredits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.\\n\\n48\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the\\ntwo programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption of the new\\nrevenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.\\n\\nDirect Vehicle Leasing Program\\n\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Currently, the\\ndirect vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U.S. and Canada. Qualifying customers are\\npermitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either\\nreturning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating\\nleases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the\\ndepreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue.\\n\\nWe capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales\\ncommissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently\\namortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the\\ntransaction price of automotive contracts.\\n\\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\\n\\nWe offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the United\\nStates. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control\\nof the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions continue to be accounted for as\\ninterest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of\\nthe vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit\\nis recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis\\nover the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating\\nlease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing\\nrevenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during\\nthe period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated\\nstatement of cash flows.\\n\\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option\\namount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances\\nwithin deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner\\nretains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive\\nleasing revenue.\\n\\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have\\nsustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market\\nconditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses\\nduring any period to date.\\n\\n49\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nVehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable\\n\\nFor certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and\\nwhere we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue\\nto recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes\\na comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the\\ncustomer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current\\nperiod activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value\\nguarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end\\nof the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as\\noperating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\\n\\nIn cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any\\nremaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the\\nleased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we\\npurchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to\\nautomotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle\\ninventory.\\n\\nServices and Other Revenue\\n\\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle\\ncomponents and systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.\\nThere were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue\\nstandard.\\n\\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are\\nrecognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We\\nsell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as\\nthe basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for\\nused vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with\\npayment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related\\ncontracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\n\\nEnergy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\\ncommercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial\\ncustomers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial\\ncustomers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small\\nscale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation\\nobligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the\\nutility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the\\nwarranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist\\nof the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been\\ndelivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such storage systems is made\\nupon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design,\\nand installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project.\\nRevenue from such contracts is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of\\ntotal estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales\\nalso include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered\\nto be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems\\nand energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers,\\nwhich is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission\\nto operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the\\nrespective contract term. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.\\n\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations\\nin the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs\\nplus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy\\nsystems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are\\npaid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to\\ncommissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs\\nrelated to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\n\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\nwarrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the\\ncontract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar\\nenergy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated\\ndamages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage\\nsystem contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such\\nguarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their\\nmost likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\n\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments\\nand remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective\\ncustomer contract term. \\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\n\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we\\nrecord lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a\\nstraight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between\\nthe payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs, we have determined that these agreements should\\nbe accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates\\nspecified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\n\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue\\nrecognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term.\\nDeferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state\\ngovernment agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term.\\n\\n51\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs, which include the incremental cost of contract\\nadministration, referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, and\\nsubsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA.\\n\\nInventory Valuation\\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage\\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual\\ncost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand\\nforecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\n\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the\\ninventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory\\non-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent\\nchanges in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\n\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may\\nbe required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n\\nWarranties\\n\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy storage\\nproducts we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for\\nperiods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of\\nthe projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our\\nrelatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the\\nwarranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to\\nlease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed\\nas incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities\\nand other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the adoption\\nof the new revenue standard, automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets\\nrequire a corresponding warranty accrual. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations.\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and our\\nemployee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards.\\nThe fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the\\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected\\nterm and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured\\non the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during\\nwhich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for\\nstock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of\\nactual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures).\\n\\n52\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of\\nindividual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For\\nperformance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions,\\nstock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected\\nachievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is\\nconsidered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.\\n\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common\\nstock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our\\nstock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation\\nexpense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our\\nprovision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax\\nassets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with\\nour future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions\\nincluding fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union\\nand a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded a full\\nvaluation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets\\nwill not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance\\ncould be materially impacted.\\n\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many\\ntransactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on\\nour tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax\\nreturn positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by\\ntax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the\\napplicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and\\nforeign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open\\naudit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our\\nestimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change\\nin estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income\\ntax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still\\nhave a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made.\\n\\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal\\nRevenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning\\nafter December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a one-time\\ntransition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes\\nin the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of\\nour deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and\\nconsolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net U.S.\\ndeferred tax assets.\\n\\n53\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting\\nImplications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not\\nto extend beyond one year from the enactment date. As such, in accordance with SAB 118, we completed our analysis during the fourth\\nquarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded\\nduring the prior year.\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling\\nfinancial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which\\nwe are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the\\nfunding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing\\nprograms. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling\\nvoting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the\\nVIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be\\nsignificant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a\\nVIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are\\nthe primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs. We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we\\ncontinue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\n\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\n\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\\narrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have\\ndetermined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined\\nthat the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects\\nthe substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”)\\nmethod. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of\\nthe funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling\\ninterests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as\\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the\\nthird-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net\\nassets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the\\nbalance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined\\nas the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets\\nbetween the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the\\nthird-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable\\nnoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these\\nthird-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.\\n\\n54\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is\\nmeasured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are\\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed\\n(including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition\\ndate. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair\\nvalue of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income\\n(expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of\\noperations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\\n\\nWhen determining such fair values, we make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates include, but are not limited to,\\nfuture expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates. Our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed\\nto be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from our estimates.\\nFurthermore, our estimates might change as additional information becomes available, as more fully discussed in Note 3, Business\\nCombinations, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n(Dollars in thousands)\\nAutomotive sales\\nAutomotive leasing\\nTotal automotive revenues\\nServices and other\\nTotal automotive & services\\n\\n   and other segment revenue\\nEnergy generation and storage\\n\\n2017\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2018\\n$ 17,631,522 $ 8,534,752\\n1,106,548\\n9,641,300\\n1,001,185\\n\\n883,461\\n18,514,983\\n1,391,041\\n\\n2018 vs. 2017\\nChange\\n$\\n\\n2017 vs. 2016\\nChange\\n$\\n\\n2016\\n$ 5,589,007 $ 9,096,770\\n(223,087 )\\n8,873,683\\n389,856\\n\\n761,759\\n6,350,766\\n467,972\\n\\n%\\n107 % $ 2,945,745\\n-20 % 344,789\\n92 % 3,290,534\\n39 % 533,213\\n\\n%\\n53 %\\n45 %\\n52 %\\n114 %\\n\\n19,906,024\\n\\n10,642,485\\n\\n6,818,738\\n\\n9,263,539\\n\\n87 % 3,823,747\\n\\n56 %\\n\\n   segment revenue\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n1,555,244\\n\\n1,116,266\\n\\n181,394\\n\\n438,978\\n\\n$ 21,461,268 $ 11,758,751 $ 7,000,132 $ 9,702,517\\n\\n39 % 934,872\\n83 % $ 4,758,619\\n\\n515 %\\n68 %\\n\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\n\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles, including access to our\\nSupercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates, as well as sales of regulatory\\ncredits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from non-ZEV regulatory credits generally follows our production and delivery\\ntrends as we have long-term contracts with existing customers for the sale of these credits. However, as we do not have long-term\\ncontracts for ZEV credit sales, revenue from sale of ZEV credits fluctuate by quarter depending on when a contract is executed with a\\nbuyer. For example, our revenue from ZEV credit sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $179.1 million while it was $0\\nin the three months ended June 30, 2018.\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles under direct lease agreements as\\nwell as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We do not yet offer leasing for\\nModel 3 vehicles.\\n\\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle\\ncomponents and systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.\\n\\n55\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n2018 Compared to 2017\\n\\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $9.10 billion, or 107%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of approximately 144,330 Model 3 deliveries from our significant production ramp in the\\nyear ended December 31, 2018, delivered at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Additionally, we\\nrecognized $1.40 billion of additional automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of\\n$58.3 million in sales of regulatory credits to $418.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. ZEV credits sales were $103.4 million\\nand non-ZEV regulatory credits sales were $315.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $279.7 million ZEV credit\\nsales and $80.6 million in non-ZEV regulatory credit sales in the year ended December 31, 2017. The growth in non-ZEV regulatory\\ncredits year-over-year was generally consistent with the delivery volume growth. The above increases in revenue were offset by a\\ndecrease of approximately 3,240 Model S and Model X deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding the impact of\\nadoption of the new revenue standard, at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017.\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue decreased $223.1 million, or 20%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of $832.7 million from the adoption of the new revenue\\nstandard, partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of\\nvehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee\\nperiod when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. When our counterparty retains ownership, any remaining balances within\\ndeferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue.\\n\\nServices and other revenue increased $389.9 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-in vehicles,\\npartially offset by lower average selling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in trade-ins of relatively lower priced non-Tesla\\nvehicles in the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, there was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our\\nfleet continues to grow. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as\\nwe wound down the program in 2017.\\n\\n2017 Compared to 2016\\n\\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $2.95 billion, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2016, primarily related to a 58% increase in deliveries to 80,060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of Model S and\\nModel X, at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period, as well as sales of 1,764 Model 3\\nvehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, sales of regulatory credits increased by $58.0 million to $360.3 million in\\nthe year ended December 31, 2017. ZEV credits sales were $279.7 million and non-ZEV regulatory credits sales were $80.6 million in the\\nyear ended December 31, 2017, compared to $215.4 million ZEV credit sales and $86.9 million in non-ZEV regulatory credit sales in the\\nyear ended December 31, 2016. The increases were partially offset by additional deferrals of Autopilot 2.0 revenue in the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017.\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $344.8 million, or 45%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an approximately 30% increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs\\nor programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017, we recognized an increase of $23.4 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale\\nvalue guarantees as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\\n\\nService and other revenue increased $533.2 million, or 114%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from\\nthe expansion of our trade-in program. Additionally, there was a $41.1 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue\\nfrom Grohmann Engineering GmbH (now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH, which we acquired on January 3, 2017, and a $68.4\\nmillion increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\n56\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\n\\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products, leasing revenue from solar\\nenergy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of solar energy systems incentives.\\n\\n2018 Compared to 2017\\n\\nEnergy generation and storage revenue increased by $439.0 million, or 39%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the\\nyear ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of Model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the\\nrecognition of $969.8 million of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard. These\\nincreases were partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended December 31,\\n2017 primarily due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost\\nefficiencies. Additionally, there were lower overall costs for Model S and Model X cash deliveries from approximately 3,240 fewer units\\ndelivered year-over-year and reductions in combined Model S and Model X average costs per unit as a result of increased manufacturing\\nefficiencies.\\n\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $219.8 million, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of $624.4 million from the adoption of the new\\nrevenue standard, partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained\\nownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers, additional service\\npersonnel in existing and new service centers, Mobile Service capabilities, parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to\\nprovide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles. Additionally, there was an overall increase in the cost of used\\nvehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced non-Tesla trade-in vehicles.

There were\\nincreases from improved Model S and Model X combined margins as costs per unit decreased year-over-year from continuing\\nmanufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales, which have no associated costs. The increases were partially\\noffset by margin dilution from Model 3 despite Model 3 margins improving year-over-year. The higher proportion of Model 3 as a\\npercentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as\\nModel 3 had a lower annualized margin than Model S and Model X due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower\\nproduction volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model\\n3.\\n\\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19% in the years ended December 31,\\n2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above.

The increase in Powerpack cost of revenue was significant year-over-year due to increases in cost of revenue\\nrecognized for commercial projects, most predominantly $72.5 million for the South Australia battery project. Additionally, costs for cash\\nand loan solar energy system projects have increased from higher installation costs, higher allocation of overhead costs from lower\\ndeployment of solar projects overall, and certain warranty related one-time charges.

In addition, our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 as\\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the Senior Notes due in\\n2025, both of which we issued during 2017.\\n\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\n\\n(Dollars in thousands)\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2018\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 Change\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n%\\nNot\\n\\n%\\nNot\\n\\nOther income (expense), net $ 21,866\\nAs a percentage of revenues\\n\\n0\\n\\n$ (125,373 ) $ 111,272\\n\\n$ 147,239\\n\\nmeaningful $ (236,645 )\\n\\nmeaningful\\n\\n% -1\\n\\n% 2\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated\\nmonetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps.

Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar\\nequivalent of $749.0 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Japanese yen. Our sources of cash are predominately\\nfrom our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt\\nfacilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings.\\n\\nOur sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products,\\nincreases in Model 3 production capacity at the Tesla Factory, the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai,\\nthe continued expansion of Gigafactory 1, the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y with the expectation to achieve volume\\nproduction by the end of 2020, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and\\nSupercharger network. We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion.\\n\\n63\\n\\n68\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn 2019, we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of\\ncapital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels. For example, based on our\\nexperience with ramping Model 3 at the Tesla Factory, we expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3 manufacturing capacity at\\nGigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont. Likewise, based on such experience and the substantial commonality\\nof components we expect between Model Y and Model 3, we believe that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than\\nthat of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at Fremont. Considering the pipeline of new products\\nplanned at this point, and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells, as well as considering all other\\ninfrastructure growth and expansion of Gigafactory 1, Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai, we currently estimate that capital\\nexpenditures will be between $2.5 to $3.0 billion annually for the next two fiscal years.  Moreover, we expect that the cash we generate\\nfrom our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt\\nobligations  (including the repayment of $920.0 million for our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1, 2019), although we may\\nchoose to seek alternative financing sources. For example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded\\nthrough indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure\\nneeds and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business.\\n\\nWe have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in\\nthe State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations\\nthrough our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant\\nrisk of default.\\n\\nWe expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with\\nadequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our\\ncapital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, retail and service locations,\\nbody shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these\\nfunds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them,\\nour operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\\n\\nIn addition, we had $1.50 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31, 2018,\\nsome of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of\\nqualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer\\ncontracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets; and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the\\nassociated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds). Upon the\\ndraw-down of any unused committed amounts, there are no restrictions on the use of such funds for general corporate purposes.

Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, lease payments directly from customers, customer\\ndeposits, sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to\\nsuppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating lease payments and\\ninterest payments on our financings.\\n\\nNet cash from operating activities changed favorably by $2.16 billion to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.10 billion during the\\nyear ended December 31, 2018 from net cash used in operating activities of $60.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\\nThis favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $1.60 billion and the\\ndecrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $554.6 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by\\nan increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries\\nand a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue\\nstandard, wherein certain vehicle sales to customer or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee were previously accounted for as\\nan in-substance operating leases are now accounted for as sales with a right of return upon control transfer. The increase in cash from\\ncertain operating activities was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory, as a result of increased Model 3 and\\nenergy products deliveries and production. Additionally, there was a decrease in customer deposits primarily due to Model 3 fulfillments\\nand an increase in other assets as we paid $141.3 million for the land use rights for Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $63.2 million as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $197.3 million partially offset by the decrease in\\nnet loss, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $134.1 million. The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster\\nprocessing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of $773.0 million, the\\nincrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expanded, the increase in resale value guarantees\\nof $326.9 million and deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the\\nincrease in customer deposits of $388.4 million primarily due to Model 3 reservations. These increases were partially offset by the\\nincrease in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a\\nresale value guarantee.\\n\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\n\\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were\\n$2.32 billion during 2018, $4.08 billion during 2017 and $1.44 billion during 2016. Capital expenditures during 2018 were $2.10 billion\\nfrom purchases of property and equipment, mainly for Model 3 production and the expansion of our customer support infrastructure, and\\n$218.8 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers.\\n\\n65\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCapital expenditures during 2017 were $3.41 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3 production and\\n$666.5 million for the design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers.

These expenditures were partially offset by\\nthe assumed cash of $342.7 million as a result of the SolarCity acquisition in 2016.\\n\\nIn 2014, we began construction of Gigafactory 1. We used $687.0 million, $1.45 billion, and $455.3 million of cash towards Gigafactory 1\\nconstruction during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively.\\n\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\n\\nCash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $1.18 billion of net borrowings under\\nautomobile asset-backed notes, $431.0 million of net borrowings under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the\\n“Credit Agreement”), $334.1 million from the issuance of solar asset-backed notes and $295.7 million of proceeds from exercises of stock\\noptions and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of $581.9 million under our vehicle\\nlease-backed loan and security agreements (the “Warehouse Agreements”), collateralized lease repayments of $559.2 million,\\nrepayments of $230.0 million of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018, and repayments of $210.2 million under\\nthe revolving aggregation credit facility.

In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries.\\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates and, in particular, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future,\\nnegatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\n\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the\\nsettlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily\\nconsisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net\\nforeign currency gain of $1.5 million in other income (expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, New\\nTaiwan dollar and Canadian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a net foreign currency loss of $52.3 million in\\nother income (expense), net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone.\\n\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied\\nto our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet dates to\\ncompute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in\\nan adverse impact of $175.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $116.0 million at December 31, 2017.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in\\ncertain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or\\nspeculative purposes.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s\\nconsolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public\\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \\n\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\n\\n70\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\\nstatements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2019\\n\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and\\nenergy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes the Company,\\nmanages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy\\ngeneration and storage.\\n\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples (“GAAP”) and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest\\nentity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in\\norder to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct\\nvehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of\\nan entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve\\ncontrolling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the\\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that\\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do\\nnot consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have\\ndetermined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs (see Note 18, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate\\nour relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany\\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\n\\nReclassifications\\n\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements\\nand the accompanying notes as a result of the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows:\\nRestricted Cash.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining the transaction price of products and services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining the\\namortization period of these obligations, significant economic incentive for residual value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves,\\nthe collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments,\\nresidual value of operating lease vehicles, depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, fair value and residual\\nvalue of solar energy systems subject to leases, warranty liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, the accrued liability for solar energy\\nsystem performance guarantees, determining lease pass-through financing obligations, the discount rates used to determine the fair\\nvalue of investment tax credits, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets, fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value\\nstock-based compensation. In addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations, including the\\nfair values and useful lives of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests. Management bases its estimates on\\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making\\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\n\\n77\\n\\n86\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nAdoption of new accounting standards\\n\\nASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC\\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective\\nmethod. As a policy election, the new revenue standard was applied only to contracts that were not substantially completed as of the date\\nof adoption. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018\\nopening balance of accumulated deficit. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and\\ncontinue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\\n\\nA majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers upon delivery to customers. For certain vehicle sales\\nwhere revenue was previously deferred as an in-substance operating lease, such as certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing\\npartners with a resale value guarantee, we now recognize revenue when the vehicles are shipped as a sale with a right of return. As a\\nresult, the corresponding operating lease asset, deferred revenue, and resale value guarantee balances as of December 31, 2017, were\\nreclassified to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. Furthermore, the warranty liability related to such vehicles has been\\naccrued as a result of the change from in-substance operating leases to vehicle sales. Prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled\\nwithout significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans, have been reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits.\\nRefer to the Automotive Revenue and Automotive Leasing Revenue sections below for further discussion of the impact on various\\ncategories of vehicle sales.\\n\\nFollowing the adoption of the new revenue standard, the revenue recognition for our other sales arrangements, including sales of solar\\nenergy systems, energy storage products, services, and sales of used vehicles, remained consistent with our historical revenue\\nrecognition policy. Under our lease pass-through fund arrangements, we do not have any further performance obligations and therefore\\nreclassified all investment tax credit (“ITC”) deferred revenue as of December 31, 2017, to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption\\nentry. The corresponding effects of the changes to lease pass-through fund arrangements are also reflected in our non-controlling\\ninterests in subsidiaries. Additionally, we have considered the impact from any new revenue arrangements in the current year that would\\nhave been accounted for differently under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, as an adjustment from adoption of the new revenue standard.\\n\\n78\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated January 1, 2018 consolidated

the new revenue standard requirements, the impact of adoption on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2018 was an increase in collateralized lease repayments of $474.2 million, from a net financing cash outflow of\\n$84.9 million to a net financing cash outflow of $559.2 million as presented, with an offsetting increase to cash outflows from operations.\\nAdditionally, the adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of\\ncomprehensive income (loss) identified above would have corresponding impacts within the operating section of the consolidated\\nstatement of cash flows.\\n\\nAutomotive Segment\\n\\nAutomotive Sales Revenue\\n\\nAutomotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\\n\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the\\ndefinition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet\\nconnectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the\\ncustomer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance\\nwith payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet\\nconnectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a\\nstraight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these\\nother features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year\\nlife of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer.\\nFor our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\n\\n81\\n\\n90\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable\\nconsideration related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods\\npresented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as\\nan offset against automotive sales revenue.\\n\\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on\\nother obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software\\nupdates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we have\\nelected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer\\nas an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive\\ncontracts.\\n\\nAutomotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee\\n\\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance\\ntheir vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with\\nautomotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of\\ndelivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at\\nthe end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.\\n\\nWith the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we now recognize revenue when control\\ntransfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe\\nthe customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine\\nwhether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is\\nexercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations\\nand the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value\\nguarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value\\nguarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. The two programs that are\\nstill being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value\\nGuarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.\\n\\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The\\namount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain\\ntransactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases, we also accrued\\ninterest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\\nthe stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period\\nor the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles,\\nnet, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\\n\\nIn cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability\\nand any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value\\nof the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the\\nguarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any\\nremaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated\\nbalance sheet to used vehicle inventory.\\n\\n82\\n\\n91\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nDeferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and\\nover-the-air software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n2018\\n\\nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value\\n\\n   guarantee— beginning of period (post adoption of new revenue\\n\\n   standard)\\nAdditions\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\\nRevenue recognized\\nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value\\n\\n$ 475,919\\n532,294\\n(13,248\\n(112,214\\n\\n)\\n)\\n\\n   guarantee— end of period\\n\\n$ 882,751\\n\\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially\\nunsatisfied, as of December 31, 2018. From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, revenue recognized during the year\\nended December 31, 2018 was $81.0 million. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value\\nguarantees, we expect to recognize $326.7 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the\\nperformance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.\\n\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\n\\nCalifornia and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for\\nsale in that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of\\nzero-emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits (“ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such\\ncredits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to\\ngreenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a\\nmanufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits, on our vehicles, and we\\nexpect to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third-parties to purchase our regulatory\\ncredits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with\\npayment terms customary to the business.\\n\\nWe recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party\\nas automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits totaled $418.6 million,\\n$360.3 million and $302.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had no deferred revenue\\nrelated to sales of automotive regulatory credits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\\n\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the\\ntwo programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption of the new\\nrevenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.\\n\\n83\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nDirect Vehicle Leasing Program\\n\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Currently, the\\ndirect vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U.S. and Canada. Qualifying customers are\\npermitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either\\nreturning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating\\nleases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the\\ndepreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we\\nrecognized $393.2 million, $220.6 million and $112.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had deferred\\n$109.8 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the\\ncontractual terms of the individual leases.\\n\\nWe capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales\\ncommissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently\\namortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the\\ntransaction price of automotive contracts.\\n\\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\\n\\nWe offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the\\nUnited States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As\\ncontrol of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions continue to be\\naccounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Under this program, cash is received for\\nthe full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer\\nupfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this\\nprogram to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of\\nautomotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue\\nrecognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in\\nthe consolidated statement of cash flows.\\n\\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option\\namount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances\\nwithin deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where the leasing partner\\nretains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive\\nleasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles,\\nwas $479.8 million as of December 31, 2018, including $309.8 million within a 12-month period. As of December 31, 2018, we had\\n$558.3 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and $92.5 million recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the\\nyear ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $332.4 million of leasing revenue related to this program.\\n\\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have\\nsustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market\\nconditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses\\nduring any period to date.\\n\\n84\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nVehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable\\n\\nFor certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and\\nwhere we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them, we continue\\nto recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes\\na comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the\\ncustomer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current\\nperiod activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value\\nguarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end\\nof the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as\\noperating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\\n\\nIn cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any\\nremaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the\\nleased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we\\npurchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to\\nautomotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle\\ninventory. As of December 31, 2018, $149.7 million of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months. For the\\nyear ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $157.9 million of leasing revenue related to this program. \\n\\nServices and Other Revenue\\n\\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle\\ncomponents to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. There were no\\nsignificant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.\\n\\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are\\nrecognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We\\nsell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as\\nthe basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for\\nused vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with\\npayment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related\\ncontracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue related to services and other\\nrevenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\n\\nEnergy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\\ncommercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial\\ncustomers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small scale commercial\\ncustomers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small\\nscale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation\\nobligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the\\nutility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the\\nwarranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist\\nof the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been\\ndelivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such storage systems is made\\nupon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\n\\n85\\n\\n94\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design,\\nand installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project.\\nRevenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage\\nof total estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales\\nalso include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered\\nto be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems\\nand energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers,\\nwhich is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission\\nto operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the\\nrespective contract term. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.\\n\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations\\nin the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs\\nplus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy\\nsystems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are\\npaid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to\\ncommissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs\\nrelated to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\n\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\nwarrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the\\ncontract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar\\nenergy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated\\ndamages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage\\nsystem contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such\\nguarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their\\nmost likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\n\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments\\nand remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective\\ncustomer contract term. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to\\n$148.7 million and $124.0 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, was\\n$41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the\\ntransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected\\ncontract length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2018, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were\\nunsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $117.9 million. Of this amount,\\nwe expect to recognize $7.0 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 30 years.\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\n\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we\\nrecord lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a\\nstraight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between\\nthe payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\n86\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), we have\\ndetermined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on\\nthe amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\n\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue\\nrecognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term.\\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $225.4 million and $206.8 million,\\nrespectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and\\nstate government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,\\ndeferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to $36.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively.\\n\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs, which include the incremental cost of contract\\nadministration, referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, and\\nsubsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA.\\n\\nRevenue by source\\n\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in thousands):\\n\\nAutomotive sales without resale value guarantee\\nAutomotive sales with resale value guarantee\\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\nEnergy generation and storage sales\\nServices and other\\nTotal revenues from sales and services\\nAutomotive leasing\\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\\nTotal revenues\\n\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n2018\\n$ 15,809,890\\n1,403,014\\n418,618\\n1,056,543\\n1,391,041\\n20,079,106\\n883,461\\n498,701\\n\\n$ 21,461,268\\n\\nCost of Revenues\\n\\nAutomotive Segment\\n\\nAutomotive Sales\\n\\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of\\ntooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to\\nour Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments\\nto warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and\\nto provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\\n\\nAutomotive Leasing\\n\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as\\nwarranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of\\nelectricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.\\n\\nServices and Other\\n\\nCosts of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and\\ncertify used vehicles, and costs for retail merchandise. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor\\ncosts, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by\\nour acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.\\n\\n87\\n\\n96\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\n\\nEnergy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty\\nexpense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In addition, where arrangements are accounted for\\nas operating leases, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance\\ncosts associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n\\nResearch and Development Costs\\n\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\n\\nMarketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\\n\\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and\\nadministrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and advertising costs of $70.0\\nmillion, $66.5 million and $48.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\\nthe difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which\\nthe differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax\\nassets to the amount expected to be realized.\\n\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe\\nthat it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties\\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\n\\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\\n\\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income\\n(loss) consists of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and available-for-sale marketable securities and foreign currency\\ntranslation adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options, restricted stock units\\n(“RSUs”) and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). The fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and the\\nESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the\\ngrant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected\\nforfeitures). Stock-based compensation associated with awards assumed from the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) is\\nmeasured as of the acquisition date using the relevant assumptions and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining requisite\\nservice period, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures).\\n\\n88\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of\\nindividual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For\\nperformance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions,\\nstock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected\\nachievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is\\nconsidered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations (see\\nNote 15, Equity Incentive Plans).\\n\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common\\nstock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our\\nstock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation\\nexpense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\n\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\n\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\\narrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have\\ndetermined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined\\nthat the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects\\nthe substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”)\\nmethod. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of\\nthe funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling\\ninterests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as\\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the\\nthird-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net\\nassets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the\\nbalance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined\\nas the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets\\nbetween the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the\\nthird-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable\\nnoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these\\nthird-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.\\n\\nNet Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\n\\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss)\\nattributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive\\nshares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and\\nconvertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted\\nnet income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle in\\ncash the principal outstanding under the 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021\\nand the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if\\nany. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our bond hedges, we entered into convertible note hedges (see Note 13, Long-Term\\nDebt Obligations). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is\\nalways anti-dilutive.\\n\\n89\\n\\n98\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share\\nof common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive:\\n\\nStock-based awards\\nConvertible senior notes\\nWarrants\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2018\\n9,928,789\\n1,432,656\\n214,213\\n\\n2017\\n10,456,363\\n2,315,463\\n579,137\\n\\n2016\\n12,091,473\\n841,191\\n262,702\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is\\nmeasured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are\\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed\\n(including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition\\ndate. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair\\nvalue of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income\\n(expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of\\noperations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our\\ncash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds.\\n\\nRestricted Cash\\n\\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for\\nour sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing\\nfacilities and certain operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors that have not been\\nreleased for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities.\\n\\nThe following table totals cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets; the sums are\\npresented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\\n\\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,\\n2018\\n$ 3,685,618\\n\\n2016\\n$ 3,393,216\\n\\n2015\\n$ 1,196,908\\n\\n2017\\n$ 3,367,914\\n\\n192,551\\n\\n155,323\\n\\n105,519\\n\\n5,961\\n\\n398,219\\n\\n441,722\\n\\n268,165\\n\\n31,522\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nRestricted cash (1)\\nRestricted cash, net of current\\n\\n   portion\\nTotal as presented in the\\n\\n   consolidated statements\\n\\n   of cash flows\\n\\n$ 4,276,388\\n\\n$ 3,964,959\\n\\n$ 3,766,900\\n\\n$ 1,234,391\\n\\n(1) In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, the restricted cash and marketable securities balance of $22.6 million\\n\\nincluded $16.7 million of marketable securities. This balance of marketable securities has been excluded in the table above.\\n\\n90\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\n\\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain systems, sales of energy generation and storage products,\\nreceivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory\\ncredits to other automotive manufacturers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance\\nagainst accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. We write-off accounts receivable when they are\\ndeemed uncollectible.\\n\\nWe typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to\\nvehicle delivery, except for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our\\ncustomers and the financial institutions.\\n\\nMyPower Customer Notes Receivable\\n\\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower was offered by SolarCity to provide residential\\ncustomers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any\\nallowance for potentially uncollectible amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses\\nand other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower customer notes receivable, net of current portion, for the long-term\\nportion. In determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable, we identify significant customers with known\\ndisputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level\\nof future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired are charged-off as a write-off of the allowance for losses.\\nSince acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of potentially\\nuncollectible amounts has been insignificant. In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of\\nDecember 31, 2018.\\n\\nConcentration of Risk\\n\\nCredit Risk\\n\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\\naccounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds\\nor on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of\\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for\\nour interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\\n\\nSupply Risk\\n\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver\\nnecessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to\\nefficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\n\\nInventory Valuation\\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage\\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual\\ncost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand\\nforecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\n\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the\\ninventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory\\non-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent\\nchanges in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\n\\n91\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may\\nbe required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n\\nOperating Lease Vehicles\\n\\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program, vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee\\nand a buyback option, as well as vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable are classified as\\noperating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases (refer to the Automotive Leasing Revenue\\nsection above for details). Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using\\nthe straight-line method over the expected operating lease term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.55 billion and $4.85 billion, respectively. Accumulated depreciation related to\\nleased vehicles as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $457.6 million and $733.3 million, respectively.\\n\\nSolar Energy Systems, Leased and To Be Leased\\n\\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating leases. Our leases are accounted for in accordance with\\nASC 840. To determine lease classification, we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain\\npurchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life or whether the present value of the\\nminimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair\\nvalues at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as\\nfollows:\\n\\nSolar energy systems leased to customers\\nInitial direct costs related to customer\\n\\n30 to 35 years\\n\\n   solar energy system lease acquisition\\n\\n   costs\\n\\nLease term (up to 25 years)\\n\\nSolar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending interconnection with the respective utility companies and\\nwill be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. Solar\\nenergy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems\\nleased to customers when they are completed, interconnected and leased to customers. Initial direct costs related to customer solar\\nenergy system lease acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease agreements.\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\ngenerally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\n\\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and\\n\\n   office furniture\\nBuilding and building improvements\\nComputer equipment and software\\n\\n2 to 12 years\\n15 to 30 years\\n3 to 10 years\\n\\nDepreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total\\nestimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life for Model S and Model X\\ntooling was 325,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life for\\nModel 3 tooling was 1,000,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production.\\n\\n92\\n\\n101\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related\\nleases.\\n\\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from\\nthe consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and\\nrepair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset\\nare capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\\n\\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on\\nconstruction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\\n\\nFurthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived assets under\\nbuild-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our\\nother commitments under the arrangements. In these cases, we recognize build-to-suit lease assets under construction and\\ncorresponding build-to-suit lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with ASC 840. Once construction is\\ncompleted, if a lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we remove the asset and liability and account for the lease as an operating\\nlease. Otherwise, the lease is accounted for as a capital lease.\\n\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\\n\\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes\\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by\\ncomparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not\\nrecoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-down to its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have recognized\\ncertain material impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 4, Intangible Assets, for further details). For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\\n\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to\\nthirty years.\\n\\nCapitalization of Software Costs\\n\\nFor costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs\\nrelated to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on\\na straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis,\\nand we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\\n\\nForeign Currency\\n\\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the\\nprimary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative\\ntranslation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period income or loss, and the\\nbalance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional currency rate to its income or loss and the month-end\\nfunctional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\\n\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in\\ncurrencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, in the\\nconsolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded foreign currency transaction\\ngains of $1.5 million, losses of $52.3 million and gains of $26.1 million, respectively.\\n\\n93\\n\\n102\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWarranties\\n\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production powertrain components and systems and energy storage\\nproducts we sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for\\nperiods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of\\nthe projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our\\nrelatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the\\nwarranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to\\nlease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed\\nas incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities\\nand other while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the adoption\\nof the new revenue standard, automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets\\nrequire a corresponding warranty accrual, which is included in the table below. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of\\nrevenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in thousands): \\n\\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\\nAssumed warranty liability from acquisition —\\nWarranty costs incurred\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2018\\n$ 401,790\\n\\n2017\\n$ 266,655\\n\\n(209,124 )\\n\\n4,737\\n(122,510 )\\n\\n2016\\n$ 180,754\\n31,366\\n(79,147 )\\n\\n   warranties, including expirations and\\n\\n   foreign exchange impact\\nAdditional warranty accrued from adoption\\n\\n(26,294 )\\n\\n4,342\\n\\n(20,084 )\\n\\n   of the new revenue standard\\nProvision for warranty\\nAccrued warranty—end of period\\n\\n37,139\\n544,315\\n$ 747,826\\n\\n—\\n248,566\\n$ 401,790\\n\\n—\\n153,766\\n$ 266,655\\n\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or\\ncollateralized debt arrangements were $21.9 million, $35.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively.\\n\\nSolar Energy System Performance Guarantees\\n\\nWe guarantee a specified minimum solar energy production output for certain solar energy systems leased or sold to customers,\\ngenerally for a term of up to 30 years. We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these outputs are being achieved. We\\nevaluate if any amounts are due to our customers and make any payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements. As of\\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, we had recognized a liability of $7.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities and\\nother on the consolidated balance sheets, related to these guarantees based on our assessment of the exposures.\\n\\nSolar Renewable Energy Credits\\n\\nWe account for solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) when they are purchased by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs generated\\nby solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as\\nthere are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. For SRECs purchased by us, we record these SRECs at their\\ncost, subject to impairment testing. We recognize revenue from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the\\ncost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to cost of revenue.\\n\\n94\\n\\n103\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nDeferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue\\n\\nWe have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Under\\nSection 50(d)(5) of the IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such\\nproperty for the purposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the ITCs to be separated from the\\nownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs. Under our lease pass-through fund arrangements, we can make a tax\\nelection to pass-through the ITCs to the investors, who are the legal lessee of the property. Therefore, we are able to monetize these\\nITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the monetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key\\nelements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems. Consequently, we consider the proceeds from the monetization of\\nITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy systems.\\n\\nIn accordance with the relevant FASB guidance, we recognize revenue from the monetization of ITCs when (1) persuasive evidence of an\\narrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and\\n(4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar energy\\nsystem either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date; the\\nrecapture amount decreases on each anniversary of the placed-in-service date. Since we have an obligation to ensure that the solar\\nenergy system is in-service and operational for a term of five years in order to avoid any recapture of the ITC, we recognize revenue as\\nthe recapture amount decreases, assuming the other revenue recognition criteria above have been met. As a result, the monetized ITC is\\ninitially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently, one-fifth of the monetized ITC is recognized\\nas energy generation and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each anniversary of the solar energy system’s\\nplaced-in-service date over five years. As discussed in the Revenue Recognition section above, following the adoption of the new\\nrevenue standard on January 1, 2018, we no longer defer the monetized ITC as deferred revenue outstanding and have reclassified all\\nITC deferred revenue as of December 31, 2017 to our opening accumulated deficit.\\n\\nWe indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture\\nevent is remote, and consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\n\\nWe have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real\\nproperty, personal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits. These\\nincentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2034\\n(depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible for a maximum of $195.0 million of transferable tax credits,\\nsubject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least $3.50 billion, which we exceeded during 2017, and\\nspecified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1, which we exceeded during 2018. We record these credits as earned when we have evidence\\nthere is a market for their sale. Credits are applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets, depending on the\\nsource of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a\\nreduction to operating expenses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had earned $195.0 million and $163.0 million of transferable tax\\ncredits under these agreements, respectively.\\n\\n95\\n\\n104\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to\\nreplace the existing revenue recognition criteria for contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,\\nDeferral of the Effective Date, to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,\\n2017. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying\\nPerformance Obligations and Licensing, ASU No. 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates\\n2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope\\nImprovements and Practical Expedients, and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements, to clarify and amend the\\nguidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative\\nadjustment to accumulated deficit. The adoption of the ASUs changed the timing of revenue recognition to be at delivery for certain\\nvehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, which now qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right\\nof return as opposed to the prior accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings. Upon adoption of the ASUs, we\\nrecorded a decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit of $623.2 million including income tax effects, which were immaterial. Refer to\\nthe Revenue Recognition section above for details.\\n\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to recognize all leases, with limited exceptions, on the\\nbalance sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting. The ASU also eliminates\\nreal estate-specific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10,\\nCodification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, and ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope\\nImprovements for Lessors, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2019 on a modified\\nretrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit balance. Prior comparative periods will not be\\nrestated under this method, and we will adopt all available practical expedients, as applicable. Further, solar leases that commence on or\\nafter January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and which are currently accounted for as leases, will no longer meet the definition of a\\nlease. Instead, solar leases commencing on or after January 1, 2019 will be accounted for under ASC 606. In addition to recognizing\\noperating leases that were previously not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet, we also expect most of our build-to-suit leases\\nto be de-recognized with a net decrease of approximately of $100.0 million to our beginning accumulated deficit before income tax\\neffects, as our build-to-suit leases will no longer qualify for build-to-suit accounting and will instead be recognized as operating leases or\\nfinance leases. Upon adoption, our consolidated balance sheet will include an overall reduction in assets in the range of approximately\\n$400.0 million to $500.0 million and a reduction in liabilities in the range of approximately $500.0 million to $600.0 million. The ASUs are\\nnot expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows.\\n\\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to require financial assets\\ncarried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions\\nand forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables\\narising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is modified retrospective. We are currently\\nobtaining an understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.\\n\\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to reduce the diversity\\nin practice with respect to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is\\neffective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We adopted the ASU\\non January 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires entities to present the\\naggregate changes in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result,\\nthe statement of cash flows now presents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of the beginning and ending balances\\nof cash and cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the\\nASU is retrospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which resulted in restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash\\nreconciling beginning and ending balances. Refer to the Restricted Cash section for the reconciliation.\\n\\n96\\n\\n105\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business, to clarify which transactions should be\\naccounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact\\non the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill\\nimpairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting\\nunit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value,\\nnot to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment\\nto determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We have not yet selected an adoption date,\\nthough the ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, Gains and Losses from the Recognition of Nonfinancial Assets, to clarify the scope\\nof asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The ASU is effective for interim and annual\\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a\\ncumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit. Upon adoption of the ASU, we recorded a $9.4 million decrease to our beginning\\naccumulated deficit balance.\\n\\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide guidance on which changes to the terms\\nor conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU is effective for interim and\\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which\\ndid not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, to simplify the\\napplication of current hedge accounting guidance. The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial\\nrisk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial\\nstatements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\\nAdoption of the ASU will be prospective for us. We plan to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, and the ASU is currently not expected to\\nhave a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition to Topic 842, to permit an entity to\\nelect a practical expedient to not re-evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02,\\nLeases, and that are not currently accounted for as leases. The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No. 2016-02, and the ASU\\nwill not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing\\nArrangement that Is a Service Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting\\narrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain\\ninternal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The ASU is effective for interim and\\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is either retrospective or\\nprospective. We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020.\\n\\nNote 3 – Business Combinations\\n\\nGrohmann Acquisition\\n\\nOn January 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH (now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH or\\n“Grohmann”), which specializes in the design, development and sale of automated manufacturing systems, for $109.5 million in cash. We\\nacquired Grohmann to improve the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\\n\\n97\\n\\n106\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nAt the time of acquisition, we entered into an incentive compensation arrangement for up to a maximum of $25.8 million of payments\\ncontingent upon continued service with us for 36 months after the acquisition date. Such payments would have been accounted for as\\ncompensation expense in the periods earned. However, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we terminated the incentive\\ncompensation arrangement and accelerated the payments thereunder. As a result, we recorded the entire $25.8 million as compensation\\nexpense in the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was included within selling, general and administrative expense in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\n\\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\\n\\nFair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and\\nassumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results of\\noperations. Significant inputs used included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates.\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed. Prior to finalization, there were no changes to the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\\n\\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration was based on management’s estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets\\nacquired and the liabilities assumed, as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAssets acquired:\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nAccounts receivable\\nInventory\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nIntangible assets\\nPrepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current\\nTotal assets acquired\\nLiabilities assumed:\\nAccounts payable\\nAccrued liabilities\\nDebt and capital leases, current and non-current\\nOther long-term liabilities\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\nNet assets acquired\\nGoodwill\\nTotal purchase price\\n\\n$ 334\\n\\n42,947\\n10,031\\n44,030\\n21,723\\n1,998\\n121,063\\n\\n(19,975 )\\n(12,403 )\\n(9,220 )\\n(10,049 )\\n(51,647 )\\n69,416\\n40,065\\n$ 109,481\\n\\nGoodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the\\nexpected synergies from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating Grohmann’s technology into our automotive business\\nas well as the acquired talent. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes and is not amortized. Rather, we assess goodwill\\nfor impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired,\\nby comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value.\\n\\n98\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets Acquired\\n\\nThe determination of the fair values of the identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives as of the acquisition date was as\\nfollows (in thousands, except for useful lives):\\n\\nFair\\nValue\\n\\nDeveloped technology $ 12,528\\n3,341\\nSoftware\\n3,236\\nCustomer relations\\n1,775\\nTrade name\\nOther\\n843\\nTotal intangible assets $ 21,723\\n\\nUseful\\nLife\\n\\n(in\\nyears)\\n\\n10\\n3\\n6\\n7\\n2\\n\\nGrohmann’s results of operations since the acquisition date have been included within the automotive segment in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n\\nSolarCity Acquisition\\n\\nOn November 21, 2016 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed our acquisition of SolarCity. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of\\nMerger (the “Merger Agreement”), each issued and outstanding share of SolarCity common stock was converted into 0.110 (the\\n“Exchange Ratio”) shares of our common stock. In addition, SolarCity’s stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were\\nassumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the\\nawards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition.\\n\\nFair Value of Purchase Consideration\\n\\nThe Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was as follows (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts):\\n\\nTotal fair value of Tesla common stock\\n\\n   issued (11,124,497 shares issued at $185.04 per share)\\nFair value of replacement Tesla stock\\n\\n$ 2,058,477\\n\\n   options and restricted stock units for vested SolarCity awards\\nTotal purchase price\\n\\n87,500\\n\\n$ 2,145,977\\n\\nFurthermore, the assumed unvested SolarCity awards of $95.9 million are recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the\\nremaining requisite service period. Per ASC 805, the replacement of stock options or other share-based payment awards in conjunction\\nwith a business combination represents a modification of share-based payment awards that must be accounted for in accordance with\\nASC 718, Stock Compensation. As a result of our issuance of replacement awards, a portion of the fair-value-based measure of the\\nreplacement awards is included in the purchase consideration. To determine the portion of the replacement awards that is part of the\\npurchase consideration, we measured the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards as of the Acquisition Date.\\nThe fair value of the replacement awards, whether vested or unvested, was included in the purchase consideration to the extent that\\npre-acquisition services were rendered.\\n\\nTransaction costs of $21.7 million were expensed as incurred to selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated\\nstatements of operations.\\n\\n99\\n\\n108\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\\n\\nFair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and\\nassumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results of\\noperations.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement\\nthat should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair\\nvalue hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such\\nas quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or\\nindirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of\\nobservable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring\\nbasis were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nDecember 31, 2018\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\nLevel I\\n\\nLevel II\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\nLevel I\\n\\nLevel\\nIII\\n\\nLevel\\nII\\n\\nLevel\\nIII\\n\\nMoney market\\n\\n   funds (cash and\\n\\n   cash equivalents\\n\\n   & restricted cash) $ 1,812,828\\nInterest rate swaps,\\n\\n1,812,828 $ —\\n\\n$ — $ 2,163,459 $ 2,163,459 $ — $ —\\n\\n   net\\nTotal\\n\\n11,070\\n\\n59\\n$ 1,823,898 $ 1,812,828 $ 11,070 $ — $ 2,163,518 $ 2,163,459 $ 59\\n\\n11,070 — 59\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n$ —\\n\\nAll of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in\\nactive markets.

During the year\\nended December 31, 2018, there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\nInterest Rate Swaps\\n\\nWe enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest\\npayments, as required by certain of our lenders.

In the case of an energy generation or storage product, customer deposits are\\nfully refundable prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with applicable\\nlaws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied towards the customer’s purchase\\nbalance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we held $792.6 million and $853.9 million, respectively, in customer\\ndeposits.\\n\\nDue to the adoption of the new revenue standard, customer deposits now include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without\\nsignificant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans, which were previously reported as deferred revenue. As a result, the adoption of\\nthe new revenue standard increased the customer deposits balance as of December 31, 2018 by $58.4 million as compared to what the\\nbalance would have been under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\\n\\n107\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nNote 13 –Long-Term Debt Obligations\\n\\nThe following is a

Holders of the 2018 Notes may\\nconvert, at their option, on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to March 1, 2018\\nonly under the following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after September 30, 2013, if the closing price of our common\\nstock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the\\nquarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive\\ntrading day period in which the trading price of the 2018 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of our common stock\\nfor each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if\\nspecified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of\\nour common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily\\nconversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to repurchase all or\\na portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\\nIn addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to\\nconvert its 2018 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.\\n\\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated\\nwith the 2018 Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $82.8 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being\\namortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29%.\\n\\nIn connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to\\npurchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $124.52 per\\nshare. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the\\nwarrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.3 million shares of our common stock\\nat a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the\\npurchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the\\n2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet\\ncertain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as\\nderivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to\\nadditional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, $5.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes were converted for $5.2 million in cash and\\n25,745 shares of our common stock.

We recorded to stockholders’ equity $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes’ conversion feature and $369.4 million for the\\n2021 Notes’ conversion feature.

The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby\\nthe holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 2.2 million shares of\\nour common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64\\nper share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of these warrants. Similarly, in connection\\nwith the issuance of the additional notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid a total of\\n$78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 0.3 million shares of\\nour common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64\\nper share for the 2021 Notes. We received $50.8 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of these warrants. Taken together, the\\npurchases of the convertible note hedges and the sales of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or cash payments\\nfrom the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share for the\\n2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the\\nconvertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives.

Therefore, the 2022 Notes are\\nclassified as long-term.\\n\\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated\\nwith the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $145.6 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being\\namortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%.\\n\\nIn connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to\\npurchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $327.50 per\\nshare. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the\\nwarrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock\\nat a price of $655.00 per share. We received $52.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the\\npurchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the\\n2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet\\ncertain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as\\nderivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to\\nadditional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\n2025 Notes\\n\\nIn August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025 pursuant to\\nRule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were\\n$1.77 billion.\\n\\nCredit Agreement\\n\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”)\\nwith a syndicate of banks.

If certain events that would constitute a make-whole fundamental change (such as significant\\nchanges in ownership, corporate structure or tradability of our common stock) occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the\\nconversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances.\\nThe maximum conversion rate is capped at 2.3635 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent\\nto a minimum conversion price of $423.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible\\nsenior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes.\\n\\nIn November 2018, the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 matured and aggregate outstanding principal of $230.0 million was\\nfully paid off.\\n\\n1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019\\n\\nIn September 2014, SolarCity issued $500.0 million and in October 2014, SolarCity issued an additional $66.0 million in aggregate\\nprincipal amount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2019 in a private placement.\\n\\nEach $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to\\na conversion price of $759.36 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers\\nor exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate is capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior\\nnotes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $573.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash\\nconversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under\\ncertain defined fundamental changes.\\n\\nIn connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September and October 2014, SolarCity entered into capped call option\\nagreements to reduce the potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes. Specifically, upon the exercise of the\\ncapped call options, we would now receive shares of our common stock equal to 745,377 shares multiplied by (a) (i) the lower of\\n$1,146.18 or the then market price of our common stock less (ii) $759.36 and divided by (b) the then market price of our common stock.\\nThe results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds $759.36 and\\napproaches $1,146.18, but we would receive less shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds $1,146.18. Consequently, if\\nthe convertible senior notes are converted, then the number of shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by the\\nshares received by us under the capped call options. We can also elect to receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares. The\\ncapped call options expire on various dates ranging from September 4, 2019 to October 29, 2019, and the formula above would be\\nadjusted in the event of a merger% a tender offer% nationalization; insolvency; delisting of our common stock% changes in law% failure to\\ndeliver% insolvency filing% stock splits, combinations, dividends, repurchases or similar events or an announcement of certain of the\\npreceding actions. Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued after a conversion of the convertible senior notes, the\\ncapped call options were separately negotiated transactions, are not a part of the terms of the convertible senior notes, do not affect the\\nrights of the convertible senior note holders and take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior notes are actually converted. The\\ncapped call options meet the criteria for equity classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always control\\nwhether settlement will be in shares or cash.\\n\\n113\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nZero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020\\n\\nIn December 2015, SolarCity issued $113.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on\\nDecember 1, 2020 in a private placement. $13.0 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related parties (see Note 21,\\nRelated Party Transactions).\\n\\nEach $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 3.3333 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to\\na conversion price of $300.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers\\nor exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior\\nnotes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $236.36 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash\\nconversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under\\ncertain defined fundamental changes. On or after June 30, 2017, the convertible senior notes are redeemable by us in the event that the\\nclosing price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the conversion price for 45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days\\nof such redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\\n\\nRelated Party Promissory Notes\\n\\nIn April, 2017, our CEO, SolarCity’s former CEO and SolarCity’s former Chief Technology Officer exchanged their $100.0 million\\n(collectively) in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Solar Bonds due in February 2018 for promissory notes in the same amounts and\\nwith substantially the same terms.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we fully repaid the $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% promissory notes\\nheld by our CEO, SolarCity’s former CEO and SolarCity’s former Chief Technology Officer.\\n\\nSolar Bonds\\n\\nSolar Bonds are senior unsecured obligations that are structurally subordinate to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\\nSolar Bonds were issued under multiple series with various terms and interest rates. See Note 21, Related Party Transactions, for Solar\\nBonds issued to related parties.\\n\\nWarehouse Agreements\\n\\nIn August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into the a loan and security agreement (the “2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for borrowings\\nsecured by the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On August 17, 2017, the 2016\\nWarehouse Agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the maturity date, and our\\nsubsidiaries entered into another loan and security agreement (the “2017 Warehouse Agreement”) with substantially the same terms as\\nand that shares the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018, the 2016 Warehouse\\nAgreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend the availability period from August 17, 2018 to August 16, 2019\\nand extend the maturity date from September 2019 to September 2020. On December 28, 2018, our subsidiaries terminated the 2017\\nWarehouse Agreement after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, and entered into a third loan and security agreement with\\nsubstantially the same terms as and that shares the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. We refer to these\\nagreements together as the “Warehouse Agreements.” Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreements generally bear interest at a\\nfixed margin above (i) LIBOR or (ii) the commercial paper rate. The Warehouse Agreements are non-recourse to our other assets.\\n\\nPursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the\\nrelated leased vehicles has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the consolidated financial statements. The\\ninterest in the future cash flows arising from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of our creditors other\\nthan pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not required to pay obligations\\nunder the Warehouse Agreements are available for distributions.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we repaid $1.16 billion of the principal outstanding under the Warehouse Agreements.\\n\\n114\\n\\n125\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCanada Credit Facility\\n\\nIn December 2016, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “Canada Credit Facility”) with a bank for borrowings\\nsecured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. In December 2017 and December 2018, the Canada Credit Facility was amended to\\nadd our interests in additional vehicle leases as collateral, allowing us to draw additional funds. Amounts drawn under the Canada Credit\\nFacility bear interest at fixed rates. The Canada Credit Facility is non-recourse to our other assets.\\n\\nTerm Loan due in 2019\\n\\nIn March 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement for a term loan. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate of the\\nlender’s cost of funds plus 3.25%. The fee for undrawn commitments is 0.85% per annum. On March 31, 2017, the agreement was\\namended to upsize the committed amount, extend the availability period and extend the maturity date. The term loan is secured by\\nsubstantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to our other assets.

On January 30, 2019, the maturity date of\\nthe term loan was further extended to April 2019.\\n\\nTerm Loan due in 2021\\n\\nIn January 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks for a term loan. The term loan bears\\ninterest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%. The term loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary,\\nincluding its interests in certain financing funds, and is non-recourse to our other assets.\\n\\nRevolving Aggregation Credit Facility\\n\\nIn May 2015, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks for a revolving aggregation credit facility. On\\nMarch 23, 2016 and June 23, 2017, the agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the\\nmaturity date. The revolving aggregation credit facility bears interest at an annual rate of 2.75% plus (i) for commercial paper loans, the\\ncommercial paper rate and (ii) for LIBOR loans, at our option, three-month LIBOR or daily LIBOR. The revolving aggregation credit facility\\nis secured by certain assets of certain of our subsidiaries and was non-recourse to our other assets. On December 28, 2018, the\\naggregate outstanding principal amount of $210.2 million was repaid and the Revolving Aggregation Credit Facility was terminated.\\n\\nCash Equity Debt I\\n\\nIn connection with the cash equity financing on May 2, 2016, SolarCity issued $121.7 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that\\nbears interest at a fixed rate.

The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. As of\\nDecember 31, 2018, these solar assets had a carrying value of $85.1 million and are included within solar energy systems, leased and to\\nbe leased, net, on the consolidated balance sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 0.05%. The cash flows\\ngenerated by these solar assets are used to service the monthly principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and\\nsatisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.

SolarCity contracted with the SPE to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy\\nsystems.\\n\\nIn connection with the pooling of the solar assets that were transferred to the SPE in November 2013, SolarCity terminated a lease\\npass-through arrangement with an investor. The lease pass-through arrangement had been accounted for as a borrowing, and the\\namount outstanding under the lease pass-through arrangement was recorded as a lease pass-through financing obligation. The balance\\nthat was then outstanding under the lease pass-through arrangement was $56.4 million. SolarCity paid the investor an aggregate of\\n$40.2 million, and the remaining balance is paid over time using the net cash flows generated by the assets previously leased under the\\nlease pass-through arrangement, after payment of the principal and interest on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and expenses related to\\nthe assets and the Solar Asset-backed Notes; this was contractually documented as a right to participate in the future cash flows of the\\nSPE (“participation interest”). The participation interest was recorded as a component of other long-term liabilities for the non-current\\nportion and accrued liabilities for the current portion. We account for the participation interest as a liability because the investor has no\\nvoting or management rights in the SPE, the participation interest would terminate upon the investor achieving a specified return and the\\ninvestor has the option to put the participation interest to us on August 3, 2021 for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve the\\nspecified return, which would require us to settle the participation interest in cash. In addition, under the terms of the participation interest,\\nwe have the option to purchase the participation interest from the investor for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve the\\nspecified return.\\n\\nSolar Asset-backed Notes, 2014-1\\n\\nIn April 2014, SolarCity pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts into a SPE and\\nissued $70.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Solar Asset-backed Notes, Series 2014-1, backed by these solar assets to\\ninvestors.

The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs\\nand stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2010 Plan may be either\\nincentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonqualified stock\\noptions may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are\\nexercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting\\nrelationship ends. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity, we assumed its equity award plans and its outstanding equity\\nawards as of the Acquisition Date. SolarCity’s outstanding equity awards were converted into equity awards to acquire our common stock\\nin share amounts and prices based on the Exchange Ratio, with the equity awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and\\nconditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. The vesting and other terms and conditions of the assumed equity awards are\\nsubstantially the same as those of the 2010 Plan.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, 9,089,194 shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2010 Plan.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity:\\n\\nStock Options\\n\\nWeighted-\\n\\nWeighted- Average\\nAverage\\nExercise\\nPrice\\n\\nRemaining Intrinsic\\nContractual Value\\nLife (Years) (Billions)\\n\\nAggregate\\n\\nNumber of\\nOptions\\n10,881,025 $ 105.56\\n22,535,566 $ 346.56\\n(1,386,509 ) $ 120.40\\n(822,228\\n) $ 315.48\\n31,207,854 $ 273.40\\n\\n7.6\\n\\n$ 2.25\\n\\nRSUs\\n\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant\\nDate Fair\\nNumber\\nValue\\nof RSUs\\n$ 265.43\\n4,689,310\\n$ 316.46\\n3,043,155\\n(1,724,395 ) $ 258.51\\n(1,349,156 ) $ 278.10\\n4,658,914\\n$ 294.63\\n\\n15,312,577 $ 206.44\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n$ 2.07\\n\\n4,656,864\\n\\n$ 294.62\\n\\nBalance, December 31, 2017\\nGranted\\nExercised or released\\nCancelled\\nBalance, December 31, 2018\\nVested and expected to vest,\\n\\n   December 31, 2018\\nExercisable and vested,\\n\\n   December 31, 2018\\n\\n7,877,652\\n\\n$ 83.45\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n$ 1.99\\n\\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $316.46, $308.71 and\\n$202.59, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with\\nmaturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, given our then limited history with employee\\ngrants, we used the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term of our employee grants; the simplified method utilizes the\\naverage of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the employee grant. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, we use our\\nhistorical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied\\nvolatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\\n\\n122\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n2018 CEO Performance Award\\n\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 20,264,042 stock option awards to our CEO (the “2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the\\nattainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the\\nCEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of\\nthe 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for\\nsuch tranche, which begins at $100 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50 billion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the\\nfollowing eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been met\\nfor the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to\\ncommon stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based\\ncompensation.\\n\\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\\n\\nTotal Annualized Revenue\\n(in billions)\\n$20.0\\n$35.0\\n$55.0\\n$75.0\\n$100.0\\n$125.0\\n$150.0\\n$ 175.0\\n\\n(in billions)\\n$1.5\\n$3.0\\n$4.5\\n$6.0\\n$8.0\\n$10.0\\n$12.0\\n$14.0\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, the following operational milestones were considered probable of achievement:\\n\\n• Total revenue of $20.0 billion;\\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion; and\\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion.\\nStock-based compensation expense associated with the 2018 CEO Performance Award is recognized over the longer of the expected\\nachievement period for each pair of market capitalization or operational milestones, beginning at the point in time when the relevant\\noperational milestone is considered probable of being met. If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based\\ncompensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided\\nsince the grant date. The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo\\nsimulation and is used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period. The probability of meeting an operational milestone\\nis based on a subjective assessment of our future financial projections. Even though no tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award\\nvest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized only when an operational milestone is considered probable of achievement regardless of how much additional market\\ncapitalization must be achieved in order for a tranche to vest. At our current market capitalization, even the first tranche of the 2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award will not vest unless our market capitalization were to approximately double from the current level and stay at that\\nincreased level for a sustained period of time. Additionally, stock-based compensation represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as\\na selling, general, and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $598.0 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the operational milestones\\nthat were considered probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years. As of\\nDecember 31, 2018, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.51 billion for the operational milestones that were\\nconsidered not probable of achievement. From March 21, 2018, when the grant was approved by our stockholders, through\\nDecember 31, 2018, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $174.9 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\n\\n123\\n\\n134\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards\\n\\nIn 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our\\nstockholders’ interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted\\nstock option awards to certain employees (excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares of our common stock. Each\\naward consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future\\nperformance milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:\\n\\n• 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle;\\n• 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;\\n• 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and\\n• 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30% for any three-year period.\\nAs of December 31, 2018, the following performance milestones had been achieved:\\n\\n• Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;\\n• Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and\\n• Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.\\nWe begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of\\nDecember 31, 2018, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $10.9 million for the performance milestone that was\\nconsidered not probable of achievement. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not record any additional stock-based\\ncompensation related to these awards. For the years ended December 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense\\nof $6.8 million and $25.3 million, respectively, related to these awards.\\n\\n2012 CEO Performance Award\\n\\nIn August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”). The\\n2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both\\nperformance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting\\ntranche requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of\\n$4.00 billion, as compared to our initial market capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2018, the market\\ncapitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved:\\n\\n• Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;\\n• Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;\\n• Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;\\n• Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;\\n• Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;\\n• Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;\\n• Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;\\n• Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and\\n• Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.\\n124\\n\\n135\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWe begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31,\\n2018, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million for the performance milestone that was considered not\\nprobable of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of\\n$0.1 million, $5.1 million and $15.8 million, respectively, related to the 2012 CEO Grant.\\n\\nOur CEO earns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he is subject to\\nincome taxes based on such base salary.

The changes in valuation\\nallowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. The 2017 additional U.S.\\ndeferred tax assets are net of re-measurement from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act. There have been no material releases of the\\nvaluation allowance. Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax\\nassets will not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance is required against all U.S. deferred tax assets. We have net $30.2 million\\nof deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the\\nexpectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.\\n\\n127\\n\\n138\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017\\nand 2016 was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nTax at statutory federal rate\\nState tax, net of federal benefit\\nNondeductible expenses\\nExcess tax benefits related to stock based\\n\\n   compensation (1)\\nForeign income rate differential\\nU.S. tax credits\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2018\\n$ (210,996 ) $ (773,162 ) $ (261,222 )\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2,792\\n65,375\\n\\n2,029\\n30,138\\n\\n568\\n26,547\\n\\n(43,977 )\\n160,370\\n(79,565 )\\n\\n(1,013,196 ) —\\n364,699\\n(109,501 )\\n\\n206,470\\n(162,865 )\\n\\n   noncontrolling interests adjustment\\nEffect of U.S. tax law change (2)\\nBargain in purchase gain\\nOther reconciling items\\nChange in valuation allowance\\nProvision for income taxes\\n\\n31,858\\n—\\n—\\n960\\n131,020\\n$ 57,837\\n\\n65,920\\n722,646\\n20,211\\n3,178\\n718,584\\n$ 31,546\\n\\n21,964\\n—\\n(31,055 )\\n785\\n225,506\\n$ 26,698\\n\\n(1) As of January 1, 2017, upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting, excess\\n\\ntax benefits from share-based award activity incurred from the prior and current years are reflected as a reduction of the provision for\\nincome taxes. The excess tax benefits result in an increase to our gross U.S. deferred tax assets that is offset by a corresponding\\nincrease to our valuation allowance.\\n\\n(2) Due to the Tax Act, our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were re-measured from 35% to 21%. The\\nchange in tax rate resulted in a decrease to our gross U.S. deferred tax assets which is offset by a corresponding decrease to our\\nvaluation allowance.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $7.30 billion of federal and $5.37 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset\\nfuture taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2028 for state purposes. A portion of these\\nlosses were generated by SolarCity prior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to change of control provisions, which limit\\nthe amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control limitations to\\nsignificantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had research and development tax credits of $256.1 million and $276.2 million for federal and state income\\ntax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in\\n2024. However, the state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general\\nbusiness tax credits of $126.8 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.\\n\\nCollectively, we had no foreign earnings as of December 31, 2018 and therefore was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax\\nprovisions of the Tax Act. However, some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings. No deferred tax liabilities for foreign\\nwithholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be\\nindefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.\\n\\nFederal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event\\nof an “ownership change”, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation\\nwould be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.\\n\\n128\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\n\\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\\n\\n$ 99,127\\n28,677\\n\\n   positions\\nAssumed uncertain tax positions through acquisition\\nDecember 31, 2016\\nDecrease in balances related to prior year tax positions\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\\n\\n   positions\\nChange in balances related to effect of U.S. tax law\\n\\n   change\\nDecember 31, 2017\\nDecrease in balances related to prior year tax positions\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\\n\\n   positions\\nDecember 31, 2018\\n\\n62,805\\n13,327\\n203,936\\n(31,493 )\\n\\n84,352\\n\\n(58,050 )\\n198,745\\n(6,347 )\\n\\n60,960\\n$ 253,357\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and\\nwere immaterial. Unrecognized tax benefits of $243.8 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits\\nwould increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.\\n\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S., California and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the\\nIRS for the years 2015 and 2016. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2017 remain subject to examination for federal income tax\\npurposes, and tax years 2004 to 2017 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax\\ncredits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2017 remain\\nsubject to examination in other U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\\n\\nThe potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\\nHowever, we cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.  \\n\\nThe U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a\\ncost-sharing arrangement.

The SUNY Foundation covers (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up\\nto $350.0 million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $274.7 million and (iii)\\n$125.3 million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of\\nNew York; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The SUNY Foundation will own\\nthe manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the\\nmanufacturing facility, we will lease the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an\\ninitial period of 10 years, with an option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we\\nbegan production at the manufacturing facility, although construction has not been fully completed as of December 31, 2018.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the build-to-suit lease arrangement, we are required to achieve specific operational milestones during the initial lease\\nterm; which include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, within western New York and within the State\\nof New York within specified periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also required to spend or incur\\n$5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other costs in the State of New York within 10 years following the\\nachievement of full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of the commissioning\\nof the manufacturing facility, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to\\npay a $41.2 million “program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the\\narrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts might become payable by us.\\n\\nThe non-cash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\\namounted to $8.0 million and $86.1 million.

The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages\\nand other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities from March 6, 2013 to March 18, 2014. After a series\\nof amendments to the original complaint, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on\\nAugust 9, 2016. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, and on December 4, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the appeal. On\\nMarch 8, 2018, the Court upheld the District Court ruling of dismissal and judgment in our favor. The case is concluded.\\n\\nSecurities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition\\n\\nBetween September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by\\npurported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the\\nmembers of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary\\nduties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class\\nand seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a\\nmotion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On\\nMarch 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on\\nthe motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, but\\nthe Delaware Supreme Court denied that request, electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their\\nanswer on May 18, 2018. The parties are proceeding with discovery. The case is set for trial in March 2020.\\n\\nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21, 2017. Those actions\\nhave been consolidated and are stayed pending the Chancery Court litigation. They include claims for violations of the federal securities\\nlaws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. That action is stayed pending the Chancery Court litigation.\\n\\nWe believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are\\nunable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.\\n\\nSecurities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles\\n\\nOn October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against\\nTesla, two of its current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified\\ncompensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6,\\n2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s preparedness\\nto produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 23, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on\\nMay 25, 2018. The court granted defendant’s motion to dismiss with leave to amend.  Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on\\nSeptember 28, 2018. We will file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to\\ndismiss is set for March 1, 2019.  We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are\\nunable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\\n\\n131\\n\\n142\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nOn October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara\\nCounty against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities by Tesla in August 2017. The complaint\\nalleges misrepresentations made by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of 2017 in\\nconnection with such offering, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of\\npurchasers of Tesla securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court.  On January 22, 2019, plaintiff\\nabandoned its effort to proceed in state court, instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers\\nin the debt offering before the same judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the\\nabove-referenced earlier filed federal court case.  On February 5, 2019, the Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to\\ndismiss the complaint in the above earlier filed case. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit\\nvigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\\n\\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\\n\\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr.\\nMusk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging that such board members breached their fiduciary\\nduties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or\\nreformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed\\nits opposition brief on November 1, 2018 and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss\\nis set for May 9, 2019.  We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.\\n\\nSecurities Litigation related to Potential Going Private Transaction\\n\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in\\nconnection with Elon Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in\\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport\\nto assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and\\nother relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16,\\n2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors.  Defendants plan to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on\\nor before March 7, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss is tentatively set for June 20, 2019.  We believe that the claims have no\\nmerit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these\\nclaims.\\n\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr.\\nMusk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a\\npotential going private transaction.  These cases have been stayed pending resolution of the stockholder class action.  In addition to\\nthese cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was filed in federal court in Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members of\\nthe Tesla board of directors as then constituted, and the parties have agreed to also stay this case pending resolution of the stockholder\\nclass action; the parties’ proposed stipulation regarding the stay is pending with the Court.  We believe that the claims have no merit and\\nintend to defend against them vigorously. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these\\nclaims.\\n\\nSettlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction\\n\\nOn October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a\\nsettlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (the “SEC”) relating to Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without admitting or\\ndenying any of the SEC’s allegations, and with no restriction on Mr. Musk’s ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other\\nthan as its Chair), among other things, we and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20 million each and agreed that an independent director\\nwill serve as Chair of the Board for at least three years, and we appointed such an independent Chair of the Board and two additional\\nindependent directors to the Board, and further enhanced our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters.\\n\\n132\\n\\n143\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\n\\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety\\nAdministration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal and\\ninternational agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests.\\n\\nIn particular, the SEC has issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Mr. Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking\\nTesla private and (b) certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to\\nModel 3 production. The DOJ has also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about each of these matters and is investigating.\\nAside from the settlement with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not\\nbeen any developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing\\ninvestigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and will continue to\\ncooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide\\nto pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects,\\ncash flows, and financial position.\\n\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an\\nunfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of\\noperations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.\\n\\nIndemnification and Guaranteed Returns\\n\\nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances\\nresulting from reductions in U.S. Treasury grants or ITCs. Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of\\nthe underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U.S. Treasury Department for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or as\\nassessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize,\\nwhen applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time,\\nincluding any guidelines issued by the U.S. Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations for purposes of claiming U.S.\\nTreasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts\\nalready recognized by us, which were immaterial, for this obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date.\\n\\nThe maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the\\nfair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the U.S. Treasury\\nDepartment would determine as fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS would\\ndetermine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants. We claim U.S. Treasury grants based\\non guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair values determined with\\nthe assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through to\\nand claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine future revisions to U.S. Treasury Department guidelines governing solar\\nenergy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably\\nestimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date.\\n\\nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of\\nincentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced.\\nWe also currently participate in one state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy\\nsystems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the\\ncontractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due\\nto a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.\\n\\nOur lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar\\nenergy systems in a fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received\\nfrom investors. Any refunds of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.\\n\\n133\\n\\n144\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nLetters of Credit\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $219.6 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\\n\\nNote 18 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\n\\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and\\nvehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various\\nfinancing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we are\\nthe primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation. We have\\nconsidered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of\\nthese VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to\\nthese VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the\\nfund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\n\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash\\nflows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax\\nbenefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the\\nagreements.\\n\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the\\nfund or the formula specified in the agreements.\\n\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\n\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds,\\nsuch as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have\\nguaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to\\nthat of other funds.

Under these\\narrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually\\nstructured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are subject to lease or\\nPPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years. These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems,\\nleased and to be leased, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nThe cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.05 billion\\nand $1.09 billion, respectively. The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $66.1 million and\\n$30.9 million, respectively. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2018 was $111.9 million, of which\\n$61.8 million was classified as a current liability. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2017 was\\n$134.8 million, of which $67.3 million was classified as a current liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is included in accrued\\nliabilities and other for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nUnder a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries,\\nand in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the\\nassigned ITCs, which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is\\naccounted for separately (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). We account for the remainder of the investor\\npayments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing obligation, which is repaid from the future\\ncustomer lease payments and any incentive rebates. A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense\\nusing the effective interest rate method.\\n\\n135\\n\\n146\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed in-service and\\nthe associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors. However, we are required to comply with certain financial\\ncovenants specified in the contractual agreements, which we had met as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we are responsible for any\\nwarranties, performance guarantees, accounting and performance reporting. Furthermore, we continue to account for the customer\\narrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements, regardless of whether the cash is received by us or\\ndirectly by the investors.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for each of the next five years and\\nthereafter, were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nThereafter\\nTotal\\n\\n$ 42,775\\n42,100\\n41,147\\n33,055\\n26,152\\n468,490\\n$ 653,719\\n\\nFor two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for its\\nobligations under the contractual agreements.\\n\\nEach lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the\\ncapacity and the placed-in-service dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon date. As part of this\\nmechanism, the master lease prepayment amount is updated, and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment\\nor entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional\\nlease pass-through financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease pass-through financing\\nobligation.\\n\\nNote 20 – Defined Contribution Plan\\n\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under\\nthe 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain\\nlimitations. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the 401(k) savings plan during the\\nyears ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\\n\\nNote 21 – Related Party Transactions\\n\\nRelated party balances were comprised of the following (in thousands):\\n\\nSolar Bonds issued to related parties\\nConvertible senior notes due to related parties\\nPromissory notes due to related parties\\n\\nDecember 31, December 31,\\n2018\\n$ 100\\n$ 2,674\\n$ —\\n\\n2017\\n$ 100\\n$ 2,519\\n$ 100,000\\n\\nThe related party transactions were primarily from debt held by our CEO, SolarCity’s former CEO and SolarCity’s former Chief\\nTechnology Officer. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the promissory notes payable to such parties were fully repaid. Refer to\\nNote 13, Long-Term Debt Obligations.\\n\\nOur convertible senior notes are not re-measured at fair value (refer to Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments). As of December 31,\\n2018 and 2017, the unpaid principal balance of convertible senior notes due to related parties is $3.0 million.\\n\\n136\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nIn November 2018, our CEO purchased from us 56,915 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a per share price equal to\\nthe last closing price of our stock prior to the execution of the purchase agreement for an aggregate $20.0 million.\\n\\nNote 22 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\\n\\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment\\nincludes the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits.\\nAdditionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services,\\nsales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our\\nacquired subsidiaries to third party customers. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture,\\ninstallation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products.

The employee termination cash expenses of\\n$27.3 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring\\nand other activities was $55.2 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and\\nstorage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible\\nasset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible.\\nConsequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13.3 million (see Note 4, Intangible Assets).\\n\\nIn October 2018, a final court order was entered approving the terms of a settlement in connection with the SEC’s legal actions relating to\\nElon Musk’s prior consideration during the third quarter of 2018 of a take-private proposal for Tesla. Consequently, we recognized\\nsettlement and legal expenses of $30.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies).\\nThese expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.\\n\\nNote 24 – Subsequent Events\\n\\nOn February 3, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (“Maxwell”). Pursuant to the definitive\\nagreement, each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a fraction of a share of our common\\nstock equal to the lesser of: (i) $4.75 divided by an average value of one share of our common stock as calculated pursuant to the\\ndefinitive agreement, and (ii) 0.0193, provided that cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock. The closing of\\nthe transaction is subject to the successful tender of a specified minimum number of Maxwell common stock in an exchange offer to be\\ncommenced by our wholly-owned subsidiary, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\\n\\nNote 25 – Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\\n\\nThe following table presents selected quarterly results of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in\\nthousands, except per share amounts):\\n\\n2018\\nTotal revenues\\nGross profit\\nNet (loss) income attributable to common\\n\\n   stockholders\\nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\\n\\n   attributable to common stockholders, basic\\nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\\n\\n   attributable to common stockholders, diluted\\n2017\\nTotal revenues\\nGross profit\\nNet loss attributable to common\\n\\n   stockholders\\nNet loss per share of common stock\\n\\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31\\nJune 30\\n\\nSeptember 30 December 31\\n\\n$ 3,408,751 $ 4,002,231 $ 6,824,413\\n$ 1,523,665\\n$ 456,526\\n\\n$ 618,930\\n\\n$ 7,225,873\\n$ 1,442,900\\n\\n$ (709,551 ) $ (717,539 ) $ 311,516\\n\\n$ 139,483\\n\\n$ (4.19\\n\\n) $ (4.22\\n\\n) $ 1.82\\n\\n$ 0.81\\n\\n$ (4.19\\n\\n) $ (4.22\\n\\n) $ 1.75\\n\\n$ 0.78\\n\\n$ 2,696,270 $ 2,789,557 $ 2,984,675\\n$ 667,946\\n\\n$ 449,140\\n\\n$ 666,615\\n\\n$ 3,288,249\\n$ 438,786\\n\\n$ (330,277 ) $ (336,397 ) $ (619,376\\n\\n) $ (675,350\\n\\n   attributable to common stockholders, basic\\nNet loss per share of common stock\\n\\n$ (2.04\\n\\n) $ (2.04\\n\\n) $ (3.70\\n\\n) $ (4.01\\n\\n   attributable to common stockholders, diluted\\n\\n$ (2.04\\n\\n) $ (2.04\\n\\n) $ (3.70\\n\\n) $ (4.01\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\n149\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n138\\n\\n150\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nITEM 9.

Internal control over\\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\\nof records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our\\nmanagement and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\\nuse or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal\\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).\\nOur management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.\\n\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control\\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, as stated in their report which is included herein.\\n\\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\n\\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any\\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2018, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nITEM 9B.

Such Indemnified Party’s\\nfailure or delay to so promptly notify the Borrower shall not limit the obligations of the Borrower to such Indemnified Party in respect of\\nsuch claim except to the extent the Borrower is actually prejudiced in its defense of such claim by such failure or delay.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be\\nconclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the\\nowner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the\\nAdministrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\\n\\n(i)Assignments by Agents.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent herein shall\\nbe assignable by the Administrative Agent or such Group Agent, as the case may be, and its successors and assigns; provided that in the\\ncase of an assignment to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or such Group Agent, so long as no Event of Default,\\nDefault or Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing, such assignment shall require the Borrower’s consent (not to be unreasonably\\nwithheld or delayed).\\n\\n(j)Limitation on Assignments and Participations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Transaction Documents, none\\nof the Administration Agent, any Group Agent or any Lender may assign or participate all or any portion of its rights and obligations\\nhereunder unless, contemporaneous with such assignment or participation, such Person makes a pro rata assignment or participation to\\nthe same assignee or participant, as the case may be, of the same rights and obligations under the TFL Warehouse Agreement.\\n\\n(k)Addition of Lenders or Groups. The Borrower may, from time to time, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each\\nGroup Agent, add additional Persons as Lenders (either to an existing Group or by creating new Groups). Each new Lender (or Group)\\nshall become a party hereto, by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, an assumption agreement (each,\\nan “Assumption Agreement”) in the form of Exhibit N hereto (which Assumption Agreement shall, in the case of any new Lender or\\nLenders, be executed by each Person in such new Lender’s Group).  \\n\\n-100-\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Authoritative Copy System Description\\n\\nAs Integrated with DocuSign, Inc. Electronic Signature Solution\\n\\nThe eContract Processes Background\\n\\nThe eOriginal, Inc. Authoritative Copy System (the “System”) enables the creation and management of Authoritative Copies and uses a\\ncombination of technological and administrative features in order to: (i) designate a single copy of the Record or Records comprising an\\neContract as being the Authoritative Copy of such eContract; (ii) manage access to and the rendering of the Authoritative Copy;\\n(iii) identify each entity who has authorized access to the System, (each such entity, a “System User”); (iv) identify which System User or\\nthird party that is not a System User (each such third party, a “Non-System User”) is the Owner of Record of the Authoritative Copy; and\\n(v) provide a means for transferring record ownership of, and the exclusive right of access to, the Authoritative Copy from the current\\nOwner of Record to a successor Owner of Record (the processes performed by the System to execute the functions described in the\\nforegoing clauses (i) through (v) are collectively referred to as the “eContract Processes”). The System comprises a Production System\\nand a Back-up System. The Production System is accessible to System Users as described herein and represents that portion of the\\nSystem of which the Vault is a part. The Production System is backed-up onto the Back-up System as described in Section J.1. below.\\nThe System gives each System User and each Authoritative Copy a unique identification number and maintains such unique identification\\nnumbers in the System’s administrative database.\\n\\nThe System enables the creation and management of Authoritative Copies, including ancillary electronic Records which amend, modify,\\nsupport and/or supplement Authoritative Copies (collectively, “eDocuments”), and the logical association of each of the eDocuments with\\nthe applicable Authoritative Copy. The System also enables the conversion of Authoritative Copies and related eDocuments from\\nelectronic media to paper media, and the conversion of Chattel Paper and ancillary documents from paper media to electronic media for\\nmanagement within the System as Authoritative Copies and eDocuments.\\n\\nThe System is integrated with the [***] ([***]) to allow eContracts and eDocuments created and, as applicable, electronically executed\\nusing [***] to be deposited into the System to be managed as Authoritative Copies and eDocuments, respectively.\\n\\nGlossary of Defined Terms:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nA.

MISSION AND PHILOSOPHY\\n\\nThe purpose of the Credit and Collections Policy is to provide Tesla Finance LLC (also referred to as Tesla Finance or TFL) with an\\norganized and repeatable practice of credit adjudication and portfolio management practices in support of Tesla vehicle sales and\\nprofitability, brand experience and loyalty. TFL underwrites credit decisions on behalf of, and acts as the servicer for, Tesla Lease Trust\\n(TLT). This policy helps establish authority, rules, process and the framework to originate, manage, and liquidate the lease portfolio\\neffectively. It is based on sound and established lending and collection practices while operating within the limitations of regulatory\\nrequirements. It is, however, not a comprehensive interpretation of specific laws and regulations governing the business but is, rather, a\\nhigh- to medium- level discussion of intent, practice, and compliance.\\n\\nWhile certain roles have specific functional responsibilities, risk management generally is a shared responsibility across the organization.\\nAlthough credit and collections are distinctly separate functions in the product lifecycle, it is imperative that there be full alignment,\\ncommunication, and transparency on overall goals, actions, and performance of the portfolio. This is accomplished through a regular and\\nfrequent feedback loop between the two functions at the appropriate levels.\\n\\nThis policy is intended to serve as a basic and practical manual. However, no document can fully replace: prudent business judgment;\\nsound assessment of a borrower’s ability, capacity, and willingness to pay; or effective decision making about a specific credit request or\\ndelinquency resolution activity that is appropriate to the situation and the needs of both the borrower and TFL. The roles and incentives of\\nthe various functions are designed to provide the appropriate alignment, unity of purpose, and check and balance to maximize the benefit\\nto the company.\\n\\n2.   CREDIT POLICY\\n\\nA.   Covered Products\\n\\nThe Tesla Lease product covers individual and joint consumer leasing, small business leasing and commercial leasing. Consumer leasing\\nis intended for consumers – individually and jointly – who wish to lease their Tesla vehicle. Small business leasing is intended for owners\\nand principals of small and medium sized enterprises who wish to lease a vehicle jointly with their business. This may allow the flexibility\\nto deduct some or all of lease payments from business income taxes (customers are always encouraged to consult with a tax\\nprofessional to understand their own particular situation and eligibility).  The lessee will be  the business and the co-less will be the\\nbusiness owners or principal. Credit worthiness will be solely evaluated based on the co-lessee, who is the business owner or principal.\\nCommercial leasing is a product offered to well- established and significant sized businesses who wish to lease in the company’s name\\nonly and with no co-buyer. This allows for the use of C-suite executives. This product is offered on a limited basis upon request.\\n\\nB.   General Policy Statement\\n\\nTFL’s policy is to review and consider all applications for Leases submitted on the Tesla portal and processed through the Loan/Lease\\nOrigination System (LOS) using an appropriate risk/reward balance. The goal of credit decisioning is to approve credit applications with\\nan acceptable probability of payment by considering the following:\\n\\n•A complete credit application,\\n\\n•A thorough credit review and analysis in support of the four facets of good credit approval\\n\\n(Ability, Stability, Credit History, and Deal Structure), and\\n\\n•Proper communication, follow up, and documentation.\\n\\n370\\n\\n\\x0c[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n371\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nC.   Risk Framework and Appetite\\n\\nTFL accepts risks generally in line with those of other U.S. captive auto finance companies. Our approach to risk management is based\\non these guiding principles:\\n\\n•Innovative support of Tesla’s sales, profitability, and brand experience\\n\\n•Strike appropriate risk/reward balance\\n\\n•Forward looking analytics with timely feedback loop\\n\\n•Robust governance and compliance\\n\\n•Overall – sound business judgment rules\\n\\nCredit Risk Appetite: Credit risk is the possibility of losses stemming from the failure of lessees to meet their financial obligations under\\nthe lease agreement. Overall, TFL’s credit risk appetite for the lease portfolio is defined by a [***] of [***]% and a [***] of [***]%. The credit\\npolicy parameters (discussed in section 2F) with [***] on [***]% and [***]% of [***] along with the [***]% are setup to ensure that risk\\nexposure and portfolio performance are at acceptable levels.\\n\\nConcentration Risk: Our leasing portfolio concentration follows that of our general business model distribution with new Tesla vehicles\\nincluding Model S and Model X. Our model mix is expected to shift and grow with the introduction of new products, such as Model 3.\\nSales are [***] in [***] and this distribution will be monitored and managed dependent on business and market conditions.\\n\\nQualitative Risk Factors: The qualitative elements of the risk appetite framework define, in general, the positioning that TFL’s\\nmanagement wishes to adopt or maintain in the course of its business model. Generally speaking, the framework is based on maintaining\\nthe following qualitative objectives:\\n\\n•A [***] and predictable risk profile based on a simple and transparent business model, focused primarily on retail customers,\\n\\n•A stable and consistent credit policy and practice to generate growth, earnings, and manage volatility,\\n\\n•An  independent  risk  function  with  active  involvement  of  senior  management  that guarantees a strong risk culture focused on\\nprotecting and ensuring an adequate return on capital, and\\n\\n•Focus on the business model and products that TFL knows sufficiently well and has the management capacity (people, systems,\\nprocesses) to execute successfully.\\n\\nD.   Credit Department Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\nThe credit function is headed by the President of Tesla Finance. Credit Analysis is performed by the Underwriting Department and is\\nauthorized to make credit decisions per the credit criteria specified in this policy.\\n\\nThe Underwriting Department evaluates and identifies the risk and merits of each application on a case by case basis. The Underwriting\\nteam are experienced and trained professionals whose primary role is to make a credit decision after conducting a full analysis of the\\n\\n372\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\napplicant’s credit worthiness within established underwriting guidelines in compliance with fair lending and other applicable regulations.\\nRegional Credit Analysts are a part of the broader Financial Services team and function as the primary interface with the customer, Sales\\nTeam and Delivery Specialists in the field, and internal teams on matters related to contracts, documents, communication and follow-up.\\nThe department is required to consult with, and escalate, deals to more senior members of the Underwriting team on approvals above the\\nspecified limits.\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n373\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\nE.   Credit Decisioning\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\ni.Complete Credit Application\\n\\nTo enable a well-rounded credit decision, a complete credit application refers to thorough and accurate information as it pertains to the\\napplicant’s income, financial resources and assets, employment and residence history, credit obligations and payment history, and the\\namount of credit desired as it relates to the vehicle configuration and options. The application specifically needs to contain:\\n\\n•Information regarding the applicant(s)\\n\\n•Valid SSN (US), SIN (Optional in Canada) or Tax ID number\\n\\n•Asset and debt (liability) information\\n\\n•Vehicle price details\\n\\n•Any trade-in, capitalized tax or additional down payments that impact capitalized cost\\n\\nThe credit application information is supplemented with the consumer credit bureau record of the applicant’s credit borrowing and\\npayment history.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, a credit application is considered incomplete when there is insufficient information to make a fully informed\\ncredit decision. Common reasons contributing to an incomplete credit application are:\\n\\n•SSN is not accurate or does not match true applicant\\n\\n•Applicant/co-applicant   did   not   have   sufficient   time,   desire,   or   available information to complete all sections at credit application\\nor upon follow up\\n\\nAn incomplete credit application can be decisioned as pending (Manual Review) or declined due to an incomplete credit application. If the\\napplicant provides the requested information, the credit department can continue to process the application through the normal process. If\\nthe applicant does not provide the requested information after reasonable attempts to obtain this information are exhausted, the adverse\\naction notice should be sent and no further action is needed.\\n\\nRequesting information from the applicant/co-applicant: When insufficient information is received, or additional information is needed to\\nsupport the credit decision process, the credit department may follow up with the applicant(s), their legally authorized representatives, or\\nTesla sales /delivery personnel as appropriate. The credit department associates  may  not  ask,  discuss,  infer,  or  consider  prohibited \\nbases  such  as  an applicant’s Race, Color, Religion, Ethnic Origin, Age (if legally eligible to contract), Sex and marital status, public\\nassistance usage with the applicant or any other individual involved in the credit transaction. Inquiries regarding the applicant’s\\nimmigration status are permissible only to ascertain TFL’s rights and remedies regarding contractual repayments and end of lease\\ntermination activities. This policy applies to all verbal, written, in person, and electronic communication methods used during the process.\\n\\nii.Credit Bureau History\\n\\n374\\n\\n\\x0cCredit history is a measure of the borrower’s creditworthiness evidenced through their current and past borrowing and payment\\nperformance. An accurate and valid SSN is crucial for pulling the right credit record. For Canadian customers, while having an accurate\\nSIN is helpful for locating a credit file, consumers are not required to provide one. The major components of the consumer bureau report\\nare:\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n•FICO Score\\n\\n•Length and performance of trade-lines\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

TFL’s primary source for [***] is [***] in the United States.\\n\\niii.Lease [***] System\\n\\nThe advantages of using [***] and grades in lending include consistency, a quick turnaround, and uniform risk assessment and\\nmonitoring. [***] are [***] into [***] based on [***] and [***] the [***] into [***] as shown below.\\n\\n[***]\\n\\niv.Unscored Applications\\n\\nAn unscored credit file signifies that there is not enough information available to compute a statistically-valid credit score or that there was\\nno credit bureau record found. Applicants without a FICO score will be considered but supplemental documentation will likely be required\\nincluding but not limited to: proof of income, proof of assets, and/or proof of home ownership and/or a higher down payment to mitigate a\\nlack of established credit history. Unscored applications may occur when a customer is new to the country, when they have not used\\ncredit actively in for many years, or when the applicant is a business.\\n\\nv.Credit Analysis\\n\\nA thorough credit analysis covers all the information provided on the credit application, vehicle pricing, and the credit bureau report. In\\naddition, there may be discussions with the applicant regarding, but not limited to, verification of income and residence, contact numbers\\nand references where appropriate. The following attributes should be considered [***] during the decisioning process.\\n\\nAbility\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nStability\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nCredit History\\n\\n[***]\\n\\n376\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nDeal Structure\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nvi.Adverse Action Reasons\\n\\nThe LOS displays the designated adverse action reasons or stipulations selected at the time the application is decisioned. For\\nconsistency and accuracy the credit department will check only the [***] reasons for the credit request denial or counter from the list\\nbelow:\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As part of this process, applications are reviewed for [***] supporting [***]. This includes: [***] – [***]. It is the\\nresponsibility of the Underwriter to determine what is [***] in the context of a credit request. All findings will be well documented within the\\nLOS.\\n\\ni.Unscored\\n\\nSee above.\\n\\nii.Commercial Leasing\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n379\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nCommercial leases will be underwritten based on the strength of the commercial entity since there is no consumer co-buyer as there is in\\nsmall business leases.\\n\\nGeneral characteristics of companies that will be considered for a commercial lease include:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nCommercial Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria and compared to the industry average as reported by [***]:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nSupplemental information may be requested and will be considered if provided such as trade references and bank ratings.\\n\\niii.Auto Decisioning\\n\\nAutomated decisioning serves to improve efficiency and maintain uniformity of decisions across applications. Automated decisioning has\\nbeen set up within TFL’s LOS. The logic generally checks the same variables evaluated in judgmental credit decisions made by a live\\nunderwriter.\\n\\nIt is important to note that auto approvals eliminate the need for manual review of the strongest segment of applications. This allows\\nUnderwriters to spend more time working on and investigating the remaining deals requiring a judgmental credit decision.\\n\\nAuto decisioning is maintained by TFL’s LOS System Administrator and will be reviewed periodically to ensure decisions are consistent\\nwith the Credit Policy. Accordingly, the System Administrator may update and adjust the logic, with authorization from TFL’s President, to\\nremain in line with business needs while remaining compliant with the Credit Policy and lending regulations.\\n\\nAuto Approval Logic:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nAuto Decline Logic:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\nIn case of a joint consumer application, [***] must be [***] or [***] to result in an automated decision.\\n\\niv.High Credit Risk Applications\\n\\nAll credit applications with [***] are generally considered high risk and may require the following investigations:\\n\\n380\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n•Proof of Employment\\n\\n•Proof of Income/Assets\\n\\n•Proof of Residence\\n\\n•Personal Cell Number\\n\\n•References\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n381\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nv.Potential Skip/Fraud Applications\\n\\nFraud detection is a challenging and rapidly changing phenomenon in lending businesses that requires an agile and measured response.\\nTo minimize the approval of potential fraudulent and skip hazards, the Underwriter must perform a careful examination of any credit\\napplication that often indicate one or more of the following characteristics:\\n\\n•Unverifiable, unsubstantiated, and questionable information\\n\\n•Aliases commonly used and reversed\\n\\n•References with incomplete information\\n\\n•Short time in residence and employment\\n\\n•Inconsistencies or facts not adding up to the overall application profile\\n\\nProper diligence should be used in analyzing the above factors in compliance with all applicable laws.\\n\\nvi.Down Payment and Trade-ins\\n\\nA down payment serves to improve TFL’s equity position in the vehicle, lower the applicant debt and payment to income ratios and\\nincreases the applicant’s vested interest in the transaction. There are no mandatory down payment requirements other than the deposits\\nfor ordering the vehicle and for the leasing program. Security deposits are not currently required in the leasing program. However, the\\ncredit decision may include a stipulation of additional down payment to qualify the customer for the lease.\\n\\nA net negative down payment exists when the value of the trade-in or upfront tax liability adds to the capitalized cost of the leased vehicle\\nand there is not an adequate cash down payment to offset the amount. When this condition exists, the Underwriter must evaluate the\\npotential impact to TFL’s equity position.\\n\\nvii.Exception Authority and Process\\n\\nTFL may consider applications from borrowers whose credit profile does not fit within the provisions of this lending policy on a case by\\ncase basis. Any exception to this policy must be for the clear benefit of TFL, meet the standards for review and approval of exception\\nleases established by this policy, and be approved by [***] and documented in the LOS. A written justification that clearly sets forth all the\\nrelevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision is needed to support the application approval.\\n\\nAdditionally, it is the responsibility of the risk department to:\\n\\n•Monitor compliance with this policy,\\n\\n•Track  the  aggregate  level  of  exceptions  to  help  detect  shifts  in  the  risk characteristics of that element(s) within the lending\\nportfolio, and\\n\\n•Regularly  analyze  aggregate  exception  levels  and  report  them  to  Senior Management.  An excessive volume or a pattern of\\nexceptions may signal an unintended or unwarranted relaxation of TFL’s underwriting standards.\\n\\n382\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nWhen viewed individually, underwriting exceptions may not appear to increase risk significantly. However, when aggregated, even well\\nmitigated exceptions increase portfolio risk to TFL, especially under adverse business and economic conditions. When higher risk\\napprovals are made on an exception basis from sound and normal underwriting policies, it is policy to make them only in limited amounts\\nand only when robust risk management practices are in place to manage and control the higher risk. Exceptions are [***] and will [***]\\nbased on [***].\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n383\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nApplicants with [***] present a significant default risk.  TFL will consider applicants with [***] with [***], and strong supporting evidence that\\n[***]. Exceptions may be made if the applicant [***]. Adequate documentation to support such an approval is required which should\\ninclude a direct in depth conversation with the applicant to gather all the material facts.\\n\\nG.   Fair Lending and Regulatory Compliance\\n\\ni.General Policy Statement\\n\\nIt is TFL’s policy to follow sound lending practices in letter and spirit to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Credit\\ndepartment will be trained and required to comply with all applicable regulations at the federal, state, and local level. In regards to Fair\\nLending, we will not discriminate in our treatment of any credit applications with respect to the following prohibited basis:\\n\\n•Race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);\\n\\n•Because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program; or\\n\\n•Because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer\\n\\nProtection Act.\\n\\nIn addition to Fair Lending, the following regulations generally apply to TFL’s leasing activities:\\n\\n•Consumer Leasing Act (Reg. M)\\n\\n•FCRA and Adverse Action Notice\\n\\n•OFAC\\n\\n•Red Flag / ID Theft\\n\\n•California Credit Score Disclosure\\n\\n•Information Security (Saleguards Rule)\\n\\n•Service Providers / Vendor Management\\n\\nIn accordance with the Fair Lending program and other regulatory compliance, it is the company’s policy to:\\n\\n•Maintain up to date regulatory policy statements,\\n\\n•Perform and document periodic training for all employees involved with any aspect of the lending transactions,\\n\\n•Perform ongoing monitoring for compliance with regulatory policies, procedures and practices,\\n\\n•Conduct a regular assessment of the marketing of leasing products, and\\n\\n•Perform meaningful oversight of compliance by Senior Management.\\n\\n384\\n\\n\\x0cii.Applicant Notification Letters\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe credit department will issue an adverse action notice within 30 days of the decision on each application that is declined or\\nconditionally approved. The LOS generates the adverse action letter which informs the applicant’s rights under law including the right to\\nobtain specific adverse action reasons by writing to us within 30 days.\\n\\nIn addition, all California applicants will receive the California Credit Score Disclosure Notice indicating the credit score, the source of that\\nscore, and information about where their score falls with respect to other consumers.\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n385\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\niii.Audit Policy\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nThe business activities of Tesla Finance are subject to periodic audits in accordance with Tesla Inc. Audit Committee rules and risk\\nassessment results. This review may cover all leases or include a sample over a predetermined period, current, past due and liquidated\\nleases. In addition, a sample of smaller leases may also be examined to ensure compliance and flag major departures from established\\npolicy and procedure.\\n\\niv.Records Retention\\n\\nThe following documents will be held for a period not less than required by relevant statutes in electronic format, where possible:\\n\\n•Original credit application,\\n\\n•Credit report obtained from a credit reporting agency,\\n\\n•Copies of all legal notices sent to the applicant,\\n\\n•Any written complaint filed by the applicant alleging a violation of the law by TFL,\\n\\n•Original copy of manufacturer’s invoice, and\\n\\n•Copy  of  the  lease  sales  contract  enforceable  in  the  jurisdiction  where  the collateral is located, whereby TFL can acquire title and\\nrepossess the collateral property in the event of a default.\\n\\nH.   Origination Risk Metrics\\n\\nTimely tracking and reporting of appropriate metrics are key to effective risk and performance management. The following metrics will be\\ntracked for appropriate actions [***]:\\n\\n[***]\\n\\n3.   COLLECTIONS AND SERVICING POLICY A.   General Policy Statement\\n\\nThe performance of a lending portfolio is subject to individual, maturation, seasonal, economic,\\n\\nand collateral factors. The role of the collections function is to satisfactorily resolve the delinquency situation taking into account the\\ncustomer’s situation, TFL’s risk exposure, and overall portfolio performance goals. At a high level the primary collections goals are to:\\n\\n•Provide outstanding customer service in line with Tesla brand values and expectations,\\n\\n•Minimize collection costs by identifying the most effective ways to allocate resources,\\n\\n•Increase collections effectiveness by assessing the cost versus benefit at the lease level,\\n\\n•Increase total recovered dollars by optimizing early to late stage collection activities while determining the ideal contact method and\\ncollection strategy, all at the lease level, and\\n\\n386\\n\\n\\x0c•Determine the ideal repossession and recovery strategy\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nB.   Loss Mitigation Department Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\nTo successfully achieve each of the above goals, the Loss Mitigation department at TFL’s servicer and TFL’s internal customer service\\nteam maintain timely, professional, compliant, and effective collection practices. The importance of immediate collection follow-up on a\\ndelinquent account cannot be over-emphasized. Account profitability is affected by\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n387\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nmore than the potential loss due to repossession. The use of a servicing partner is an important complement to the lease origination\\nfunction. Employing the expertise of a well-established servicer relieves the company of the many details of this function and can\\neffectively minimize losses, provide outstanding customer service, and reduce the costs of collection.\\n\\nDaily collections efforts are performed by the servicer’s Loss Mitigation Team and managed by the Customer Service and Operations\\nManager at Tesla. The Loss Mitigation Team is currently comprised of trained collection representatives, each of whom is trained in\\ncustomer service, client interaction anDd collections. Leads or Supervisors oversee the daily actions of up to five representatives, with a\\nmanager for every two or three leads/supervisors. Each of these functional managers has been at the servicer for more than 10 years,\\nand has worked with the Tesla Roadster lease program from inception.\\n\\nTesla’s Customer Service and Operations Manager maintains frequent (often daily) interaction with the servicer’s Loss Mitigation\\nManager and is kept abreast of lease level collection efforts through shared reporting and bi-monthly review. The CSO Manager remains\\nthe servicer’s primary point of contact for escalations that require expedient treatment. While the CSO Manager acts as the servicer’s\\nprimary escalation point, it is the CSO Manager’s responsibility to report abnormal risk exposure to the President of TFL.\\n\\nC.   Collections Treatment Strategy and Plan\\n\\nThe timing and intensity of collections activity is determined by the delinquency stage, risk exposure, and the customers’ ability and\\nwillingness to fulfill the agreed upon course of action. A combination of relationship building, customer service, and assertive collection\\nskills are critical in an effective collector. The collections process will generally escalate from customer service (how can we help?)\\ntowards a front-line collections (when can we expect payment?) approach as the customer’s delinquency and risk of default increases.\\n\\nAll past due lease accounts are evaluated on their payment due date and assigned a specific collection strategy which includes payment\\nnotices, emails and telephone follow- up calls as part of the delinquency lifecycle activity stream.\\n\\ni.Initial Delinquency/Customer Service Call\\n\\nUnless the situation requires it, the [***] an account would be worked is [***]. At this point, Tesla’s customer service team will perform\\ncourtesy calls and emails to ensure billing related questions (the most common reason for early stage delinquency) are resolved.\\n\\nii.Formal Daily Collection Activity\\n\\nOnce account becomes [***], Tesla will turn over formal collections activity to our servicer’s Loss Mitigation Team. The team is composed\\nof representatives assigned the responsibility of handling outbound and inbound calls. Representatives handling outbound calls review\\ncollection lists and place calls to delinquent accounts. Representatives should attempt to address customer delinquency on a one-call\\nresolution basis.\\n\\nThe Work List sequences accounts for follow-up by the associate based upon the review date and payment due date. This list displays\\nthe first ‘available’ account on the collection list and requires the associate to work the account before moving on to the next account\\nrequiring collection activity.\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n388\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n389\\n\\n\\x0c tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\nConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\nAn ’available’ account is one that:\\n\\n•Is scheduled to be worked that day\\n\\n•Is not being worked by another associate\\n\\n•Has not been worked that day\\n\\nOnce an account has been worked, the representative must assign a specific activity code describing the collection effort, and leave\\ndetailed notes of the collection activity in the customer’s account. Tesla’s customer service team has viewing access to account notes\\nand is prepared to pick up where the servicer’s team left off should the customer contact a Tesla representative regarding payment.\\n\\niii.Collections Risk Strategy\\n\\nGiven the size, quality and expected performance of our portfolio, all delinquent accounts are [***] on [***].

Representatives are not to demonstrate conduct that is annoying, illegal, or harassing.\\n\\nRepresentatives must utilize effective and professional telephone skills when contacting customers. When speaking with the customer,\\nrepresentatives must identify themselves and state they are calling on behalf of Tesla Finance.\\n\\nRepresentatives must not indicate they are calling on behalf of Tesla Finance when speaking to a party other than the debtor or when\\nleaving voice messages.\\n\\nRepresentatives should communicate in a clear, confident and polite manner and treat all customers fairly, courteously and equitably.\\nUpon assuming control of the conversation, representatives should employ the following guidelines:\\n\\n[***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been\\nrequested with respect to the omitted portions.\\n\\n392\\n\\n\\x0cConfidential Treatment Requested by Tesla, Inc.\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n•Determine the customer\\'s financial situation.\\n\\n•Demonstrate  understanding  by  allowing  the  customer  the  opportunity  to  propose solutions to the delinquency. Customers are more\\nlikely to follow through on their own proposals or promises rather than those suggested by the representative.\\n\\n•Explore viable short-term and long-term solutions to the delinquency.\\n\\n•Offer the customer satisfactory payment arrangements to remit the full amount due, including late charges.*\\n\\n•Obtain a specific and detailed payment commitment from the customer for bringing the account current.\\n\\n•Emphasize to the customer the importance of keeping the payment arrangements.\\n\\n•Follow-up on promises or commitments to pay on agreed upon dates.\\n\\n•Promote positive customer relations.\\n\\n*Once payment arrangements are obtained, the loss mitigation representative should ensure the appropriate system entry notes and\\nupdate tasks are accomplished.\\n\\nviii.       Telephone Collection Policy\\n\\nTFL collection procedures emphasize the use of the telephone as the primary means for contacting delinquent customers. Telephone\\ncontact is timely and often provides for immediate results. When conducting telephone collections, it is policy to treat all delinquent\\ncustomers in a fair manner and comply with all regulations. A delinquent customer is entitled to receive helpful assistance in a courteous\\nmanner.\\n\\nObjectives:\\n\\nThe representative\\'s main objectives in contacting the customer should be:\\n\\n•Verify  pertinent customer information such as current home address, home and/or business telephone number, and employment status.\\n\\n•Obtain the reason(s) for delinquency.\\n\\n•Obtain a firm commitment from  the  customer  on  payment  arrangements for bringing the account current and keeping the account\\ncurrent until account liquidation.\\n\\nIt is essential that the reason for delinquency is determined, notated on the system, and the account delinquency is resolved on the initial\\ncustomer contact (once and done).\\n\\nBasic Guidelines for Effective Customer Interaction\\n\\nEach customer has a reason(s) for delinquency; therefore, the representative must evaluate and work each account on an individual\\nbasis. The representative must maintain a positive and professional approach in resolving the delinquency situation of each account. The\\n\\n393\\n\\n\\x0cbasic guidelines are as follows:\\n\\n tsla-10k_20181231.htm\\n\\n•Focus on Specifics - The representative must focus on the specifics  of  the delinquency situation. A customer may overreact to the most\\nbusiness like collection contact by raising his/her voice or by using profanity. Representatives should not take these actions personally\\nand never reply in kind.\\n\\n•Build and Maintain Self-Confidence and Self-Esteem – Representatives must emphasize the benefits of keeping the account in good\\nstanding, without engaging in any threats, implied or otherwise.\\n\\n•Build and Maintain a Positive, Constructive Relationship – Representatives must advise the customer of their intention to help resolve\\nthe situation.\\n\\nD.
